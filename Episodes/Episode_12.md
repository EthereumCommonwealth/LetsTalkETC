# Let's Talk ETC: Maxwell Sanchez & Justin Fisher - Proof of Proof.
**Christian Seberino:**
hello and welcome to another edition of
let's talk ETC once again I will be
running the show as Carlo is still on
travel today I have two guests with me
Maxwell Sanchez and Justin lyst state is
that i pronounce that correctly 




**Justin Fisher:**
you
were close Justin Fisher




**Christian Seberino:**
 Oh Justin
Fisher I'm sorry and they are from Vera
block right did I say that dress



**Justin Fisher:**
 yes
Caroline


**Christian Seberino:**
 okay and so they're going to
talk about their technology that they've
been working on and I've chatted with
Max before it well Justin as well and
they are very bright guys I'm sure you
will benefit from this discussion so
let's get right to it so why don't
we first do this let's have the audience
learn a little bit about you guys I
so max why don't you go first





**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 share my
name's Michael Sanchez I've been the
station's 2011 and developing software
for since 2012 started out fairly simply
writing I wrote the first GUI for
peercoin I did a lot of really kind of
ancillary software mining management
tools things like that I played around a
lot in the mining space never to
seriously by charge a small company that
built mining hardware and another one
I'm 2014 the dude bursts coin mining
with rented servers and plotted hard
drives and I'm also behind the Cure
Coyne project which is a cryptocurrency
that incentivizes protein folding for
Stanford University and through all that
I ended up meeting up with Justin about
two years ago and sometimes are working
on Vera block and the various projects
that we've been creating which are
primarily the better blockchain
and then also another spin-off project
we've been working on us a long time
watching it custody which is using
bitcoins proofs and validation abilities
to basically ensure the integrity of
digital evidence for things like police
officers 911 services things like that





**Christian Seberino:**
okay and Justin would you please
introduce yourself



**Justin Fisher:**
sure Thank You
Christian my name is Justin Fisher I'm
the co-founder CEO here at Vera block by
backgrounds primarily an Internet
bandwidth web hosting financial
information services and
telecommunications co-founded some
ISPs helped on the launch of an internet
bank that was recently sold and I came
in contact with the crypto space I'm a
linux advocate since 94 95 we do so
slack works where I made my bones
I remember that I attempted Linux
by scratch I wouldn't consider it a
success but it was a great learning
experience and um so you know being an
advocate of Linux and no fascinated with
all of its abilities that's what it
offers any time in a bit by the
bookstore I always try to support the
community by buying pretty much any
Linux magazine that they have and I'll
just stack them up and enjoy a lot of
reading for the week so in my for way of
doing that exercise i came across
Bitcoin and I it was linux journal it
was one of the rags I don't know which
one and I was fascinated and one of the
statistics that stood out with me was
the fact that I think the market cap was
like 26 million at the time though I
don't know what the date would be but if
you look at the market cap it would be
around when it was 26 million and it was
you know trading pennies to a doll or
something like that it was starting to
get a little buzz and kind of piqued my
interest cuz I remember no I Cass
coming and going back in the 90s and
attempts it you know digital gold and
all these other things in and I hadn't
really connected the dots like many
people in the space so that was kind of
my foray in my intro into the space and
I had reached out to one of her
co-founders of bear black Jeff roschmann
and I said hey you know we should look
at this space and we were working on the
project at the time he said you know it
wasn't really that interesting men in
13b heard about all the investments
breaking out and a lot of the smart
money smart money started to come in so
revisited the space and one thing led to
another yadda Max and I connected
at a conference in miami a North America
coin conference and one of the interests
one of the reasons that I connected with
Max was because I'll wrap it up here is
that he was working on a cure coin which
was very similar to an idea that I had
for like everybody who comes into the
space a more efficient way to do proof
of work which we'll get into that later
but now easily at the time I thought
because my son was doing a lot of stuff
with blender another great source
project and I saw similarities between
you know blender and doing rendering to
that as a form of proof of work and I
approached max about the idea of doing
what's called render coin which we never
launched but the idea was very
interesting to us and he shot me back a
white paper it just destroyed the idea
right and I thought this guy's really
smart and we hit it off after that and
and again we really started hitting the
getting traction with some project for
using a Bitcoin to secure digital
evidence so that's just a little bit
about my background Thank You Christian





**Christian Seberino:**
so just for the audience as I told you
these guys that are very bright guys
Justin you seem like you might be a
kindred spirit when I first learned
about linux I had the intuition that it
was going to be huge it was going to
help humanity which is open source I was
completely enthralled like you and I
couldn't get enough of it and learned
everything I could I didn't remember a
boss saying Chris you got to knock this
off you got to do some windows stuff and
I refuse the treasuring them and then
this coin kind of reminds the block
chains in general kind of reminds me of
that but I kind of have that same
intuition that this is I can't no a
amount of time that I spend it too much
because it's just like Linux is going to
be huge obviously and that were you kind
of the same way




**Justin Fisher:**
 yes I mean I'm
obviously I'm not is technically no I
go down my I know some administration
you know I'm not I'm not like a hardcore
expert by any stretch of the imagination
but my affection and appreciation from a
macro perspective I think definitely
aligns with a lot of the core
philosophies you described and and I by
the way I looked at your LinkedIn
profile and I see that you're an
advocate of homeschooling




**Christian Seberino:**
 yes that's
right




**Justin Fisher:**
 what my son was also
homeschooled 



**Christian Seberino:**
okay wonderful
that's worked out well for it so
let's talk about the your technology
actually before we do that so how did
you find out about ethereum and classic
and what do you think about ethereum
classic action 




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
so forth herein classic
I was falling of course the ethereum
project is gained a lot of traction got
a lot of trading volume each market cap
and then of course that happened and I
was watching how all that was going to
go down and I was actually talking about
Justin we were we getting the kind of
long philosophical discussions of you
know what's you know separating purity
from reality and whatnot and there's all
the issues upcoming with the etherium
fork and we were thinking you know
assyrians original branding was hey you
know let's you know the code is law
and then it's okay
that you know change that wall and you
know there's reasons to do so bug fixes
adding new features things like that but
when there is you know kind of a bailout
type of a situation it seems like you
know they people will subscribe to a
contract and you know code is rather
than let code bball and so we and then
we saw the ethereum classic project and
we saw that taking off and getting some
traction and it looks really interesting
and we followed it of course we got some
least i got some i think Justin probably
did to some ethereum classic tokens from
the split because you get ethereum 
here in classic I bought some more
classic a few months later on the
advice of pretty much the community
whose those involved in saying it what's
interesting and so we met up with Carlo
in New York spent today talking about
the two projects or project and if
you're in classic and really just got
into it from a purity perspective which
will kind of go into
a little bit later with them it's going
and proof of work and how we see all
that turning out but the fact that you
know let code be law and make changes
when you need to change the protocol not
when someone made a mistake given the
current protocol and you need to bail
them out so we really align
philosophically with those sorts of
ideals and the project was interesting I
got a lot of traction so we kept home




**Christian Seberino:**
okay great Justin do you want to add
anything to that




**Justin Fisher:**
 yes he you know I
thought the etherion project you know I
bought into the concept of smart
contracts I think it was a wonderful
idea I probably when I I actually
originally I had a minor just kind of an
interest stake in the ICO  it was real
exciting I didn't really understand the
tech like I do today it was more just I
was I was enthralled by the notion of a
smart contract and it really excited me
I wanted to see the project unfold see
where it could go and i know i got
out at around 250 and tried to get back
in and whatnot and traded around and I
got caught in the dowel thing and
again we're talking few hundred bucks
and nothing crazy but the experience was
enough for me to say you know I just
kind of felt like the rollback was
helped some people but you know if you
were holding it and you watched your
first line it hurt you so act like well
you know we're hurting one to help
another and you know and at the end of
the day you've got to let things where
they're going to be and go where they're
going to go so um for me if you're in
classic when i read i think it was a
post by barry silbert man I think
he's a good mind in the space and when I
watched him get when he kind of liked
what I heard other people voicing
similar philosophies that I adhere to
and I'm not perfect I don't know if I'm
right I just seemed to me like you know
code as long as what we said you know
what let's live and die by our
decisions and when he came around and
kind of supported it and I
I thought oh wow they're still mining
the coin this is really exciting so I
mean how can you not like that I mean I
principal I how can you not like that
and just had so much more respect for
the project even more so after that it
just excited that notion excited i guess
i'm a sucker like that 





**Christian Seberino:**
i'm sure that
that will be encouraging to ETC bands
that you know business people are
attracted by the philosophy the social
contract that was always the
hope that those principles would be
valuable email all in business also that
there'd be a value to that financially
among other benefits all right so i was
reading about your proof of proof is
that paper i was reading about that idea
and that seemed like a really cool idea
was something like I I kind of wish I
would have thought of actually but if I
want what you can talk about it but
basically your if I understand correctly
you're leveraging the but not I don't
know if trust as we want to use that
word but you're leveraging the
credibility and everyone's face in the
Bitcoin system right to work that you
little project little new
altcoins could you bitcoins that correct




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
yes so the idea is bitcoin is
incredibly secure you have ridiculous
hashrate behind that you have an
incredible community built around it
it's very decentralized and
distributed as the idea was to adopt
that because bitcoin at the end of the
day isn't about you know you can move
money on Bitcoin as one use of it but
the real value of Bitcoin is the ability
to prove that something happens whether
it be moving money or that data existed
at a certain time and so being able to
leverage that immutability of Bitcoin
and then give that to other blockchains
that want to adopt it for doing enhance
their security either new blockchains
coming out or blockchains like if
you're in classic perhaps that have
potential concerns about you know could
be forked out from ethereum there's some
contention San hashing algorithm you
know your sort of the target so we
thought watch chains like
would be really good to get on
board of the technology but it's all
about any blockchain that needs to or
want to enhance the current consensus
security they have we're talking about
making sure that forks at you know the
consensus levels not code for anything
but forking of you know minor attacks
the network and does a 51-percent attack
or something similar we wanted to
provide Bitcoin security down to those
chains and one with that additional
layer of security or also for proof of
state coins that additional arm being
able to get around issues concerning
week subjectivity and node bootstrapping
I think I pretty much any block
chain and it straps on top it doesn't
replace what are the block chains are
doing their consensus it straps on top
and then adds long-term consensus and
security and assurance to what they're
already doing 





**Christian Seberino:**
so is it correct to say
that says because that's the first
thought that came to my mind when Justin
mentioned this blender blockchain and
then you talked about the protein
folding watch chain if everybody has
these interesting projects they don't
have the mining power right but so your
proof of proof system can bring the full
brunt all the firepower that Bitcoin has
for everybody's favorite little
blockchain system is that correct all
backward 




**Justin Fisher:**
if I can just if you know I
think max what do you think about the
idea of maybe presenting a quick a quick
sound bite on kind of the evolution of
the idea because it might the idea that
so Max and Ike we evolved into the idea
i was looking at another play for a vc
friend of mine he was thinking about
investing in body cameras after the
issue in outside of st. Louis and you
know at the same time I was also looking
at render coin and the project idea had
fallen apart and I thought my gosh you
know we were talking about securing date
I mean what if you know what if you took
those cams and you were securing it you
were taking those hashes and securing it
to Bitcoin in real time it would be
irrefutable evidence and we came up with
the name you know blockchain of custody
instead of chain of custody
so we thought wow that's really clever
that's cute you know that actually we
actually take a traditional idea we show
how this new idea can be a actually a
better solution I mean fundamentally
when you look at chain of custody in a
legacy environment the longer the
evidence remains in custody the less
secure it becomes we're in a blackchain 
of custody the longer remains in
custody the more secure it becomes when
you look at that underlying principle
that to me you know it shows clearly
that there's something special going on
you're the evolution of that project you
know I got to thinking with Mexico and
we were like that's when I learned and
again I'm you know figuring this out I
didn't even understand the idea that a
blockchain couldn't secure itself
because it can't hold a private key and
that's where the idea of proof proof
evolved what is that you know could we
could we adhere to the principles of the
attributes that no proof of work has you
know trustless decentralized permission
list and transparent could we take those
attributes and carry it over to a
mechanism where no humans are
mechanically turkey if you will to act
on behalf of a blockchain following
those attributes and that's that's kind
of where that idea evolved from
versus you know certainly you can have a
federation or a central authority act on
behalf but you know here we've got that
human element again so truthful proof
was about overcoming that obstacle of
even centralized time stamping we wanted
to do it in a decentralized manner that
was our goal I don't know 






**Maxwell Sanchez:**
and then sort
of the point about blockchains not being
able to hold a private key and secure
themselves kind of like the Bitcoin
paradigm of you know Bitcoin can't my
itself good coin can though incentivize
people to mine for of same kind of
parallels proof of proof of watching
can't act on its own behalf and publish
data to another blockchain in a you
know reliable manner but it can pay
people and then validate that the work
was done correctly and so we're bringing
that same paradigm over to instead of
mining traditionally proof or do
in mining of publication putting data
somewhere and improving that you did so




**Christian Seberino:**
yes now you guys are very polite I know
you guys don't want to start any turf
wars with any other technologies but if
you if you don't mind I'd love to hear
your thoughts about some some other
ideas because other people have maybe
don't have exactly your idea but I other
ideas that try to build on the Bitcoin
system comes to mind by colored coins
rootstock side chains do you want to
maybe comment of what else is out there
and how you guys fit into that nest




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 sure
so on the level of consensus protocols
and being able to inherit security
from other block chains or right on top
of them other stuff like merge mining
emerge mining encounters some potential
attack vectors with essentially there's
an adoption curve which is a little bit
difficult where as you know merge my
blockchange is call it you know
namecoin or whatever one they have to
get Bitcoin miners to actively watch
their network and monitor it and
maintain very much a full note on that
network and also to do traditional
Bitcoin mining so they have two one a
dot here about your project to decide to
adopt it and then work it into their
system and so there's there's a
difficulty of adoption there where you
know you put a transaction on Bitcoin
you don't have to talk to the miners you
have to go to the miners and tell them
hey I'm going to do a transaction is
everyone cool if you just submit your
transaction it goes into the network we
wanted inheriting security to be similar
where you know you don't have to go to
the Bitcoin miners there any net to know
you exist they don't care because we saw
you know with merge lying or something
then having to run you know namecoin
note or something is almost like a block
size increase effectively because
they're validating more data they're
doing more work they have more bandwidth
requirements to be able to mine
effectively whereas you know we want to
inherit the security without their
permission without their interplay and
then there's also an issue of even when
you get you know some of them you don't
get all the Bitcoin Patrick if you get
thirty percent of the miners you get
thirty percent of Bitcoin cash rate and
the other whatever
seventy percent there could you know
turn around and potentially attack your
chain while still mining bitcoins so
there's not as much of a deterrent from
them performing a forking attack because
they can continue in most
implementations emerged linings we can
continue to mine bitcoin or whatever
coin normally while they attack your
network instead of switching from mining
Bitcoin to not money Bitcoin there's not
that opportunity cost so that was much
money emerging is a great idea and
there's a lot of interplay between merge
mining and our technology where you
could use merge mining to create initial
consensus and then proof approve to
create long-term consensus 





**Justin Fisher:**
and now with
the incentive I an attack and then do
just kind of summarize what Mac said
kind of like Anna layman's term if you
look at namecoin for example as emerged
mining platform great I've loved the
project type I really want to see where
it goes i like the idea of decentralized
dns but with so for example you know
namecoin if let's say at some point one
of the domain names becomes worth
hundred million dollars or fifty billion
owls well the miners that bitcoin would
be highly incentivized to turn around
and attack the minority one so that's
kind of where that i just wanted to put
that example out there back that's my
job i do the kind of the macro i try to
like simplify it and max make sure I
stay on the rails I think that's




**Christian Seberino:**
 not
good if I could just help you i can add
my own simplification so merge mining
basically in a nutshell does all this
cool stuff as long as they could get
permission from the miners whereas you
guys are another option that where you
don't need to ask you don't need any
special permissions and special hard
fork for bitcoin and you get the full
power of the mind  




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
and regular
mining doesn't require anything to be
changed in regular merge my name with
bitcoins requiring a Bitcoin protocol
changes um that does require
adoption of the miners and getting them
q understand and support your project
and then the opportunity cost so the
main things we tried to solve with merge
mining or the two working together would
be not needing to get Bitcoin miners
involved
and also not having a very low
opportunity cost of attacking the
network and if you look together
very well you can merge mine a coin
and then do proof of proof and it's not
a replacements not one or the other
there the more technology that can
be used together 




**Christian Seberino:**
and then do you want to
say something about colored coins and
rootstock those are two other projects
that come to mind that try to build on
top of it how do you





**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 sure so in the
perspective of all colored coins what we
call like laird technologies or embedded
protocols things that ride on the
Bitcoin blockchain they're very
secure there are secure Bitcoin
essentially unless they have an
underlying you know protocol issue
that's unrelated consensus but consensus
why they are secure is Bitcoin the issue
really comes down to scalability you
know Bitcoin we have one make that block
size right now it's it's another thing
we should increase in fact my personal
bleeders we should either keep the fame
or decrease it to make Bitcoin and
efficient providers of proof rather than
a high volume transaction network
neither here nor there but embedded
protocols in Bitcoin or any other token
I'll really do say scalability issues
because their entire blockchain or at
least the important parts of their block
chain in the case of punches like all
new layer mcculloch ones they need to
be embedded Bitcoin and that's very
limited very expensive space and so
every time you do a counterparty
transaction every time you do an omni
layer transaction all you end up in
clearing a Bitcoin transaction fee so
it's it's a very expensive way to
inherit debt security it works very
secure and depending on the
underlying block shanna can scale to
various degrees and there are ways to
create things like payment channels on
top of layer technologies but at a
foundation you are sort of at the
whim of the network you ride upon and
you don't get to make major decisions
about your block chain structure because
you are very very limited in of course
the space you can use in turn also the
a lot of these interfaces with the Qin
protocol to various degrees counterparty
for example uses regular Bitcoin
addresses so if you wanted to do you
know some kind of post quantum computing
signature or something would be very
very difficult between both the space
they require and also bridging away from
the Bitcoin protocol to do that in an
embedded okay platform




**Christian Seberino:**
 so if I
understand you correctly you talked
about the expense of colored coins would
it be correct to say that it has a lot
of security but it it some might say
that it in hugs but the Bitcoin system
too tightly and so it's less flexible
whereas if somebody wants more
flexibility your system was would
provide that but at the same time still
connect to them to the Bitcoin and
provide the security as well that
accurate statement for 




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
sure yes if you
want more control over your blockchain
the things like block size or whatever
you want to have more control over
your own protocol for everything
structured that's really that's the
reason people create their own block
chains and doing that as opposed to an
embedded protocol using us they can
still get that security from Bitcoin
without having to adhere to the
constraints of Bitcoin or being tied to
Bitcoin and certain of the technological
fashionable using Bitcoin addresses or
whatever that are basically requirements
to be you know at all efficient so
embedded protocols are expensive and
throughout the limits of Bitcoin
transaction fees is you know you're in
counterparty tokens and for the coin
transaction fee is higher than the
values your tokens you effectively lost
your tokens




**Christian Seberino:**
 yes we're all your system
you could do you know a thousand
transactions on your alternate
blockchain and then have only incur the
cost of maybe one or a few Bitcoin
transactions like Jax 




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
yes exactly and
then that cost could be subsidized
by sort of like a coin based reward
similar to Bitcoin mining where you know
people are getting paid to perform this
it's not like the developers of the coin
or doing this or have to do this or
anything it's a decentralized
distributed instead of
double system where people are coming in
doing that security work for proof
approved mining on behalf of support in
the blockchain or the partners watching
auxiliary watching and they're bringing
that up to Bitcoin proving if they did
it in such a way that the other blockchain 
can operate however wants to
operate all that matters is that it can
validate




**Christian Seberino:**
 so periodically yes
periodically crunching Justin
do you want to say something 





**Justin Fisher:**
no I
think Matt you know max encompassed it
you know I when we talk about block
size smaller instead of larger the
idea of being behind and you know
without going into the religion of it
if you look at for me personally in my
journey um I keep circling back to
bitcoin is proof and that it's
fundamentally from the perspective of a
legacy chain of custody versus a block
chain of custody you just simply look at
that dichotomy it completely expresses
an intangible aspect that I'm moffat i'm
personally most fascinated and excited
by it whatever you want to call that
however you want to refer to it whatever
it becomes whatever t files to on that
notion that intangible value the proof
to me is fundamentally fascinating so
then that begets the question well if
you have a larger block size does it
make it harder for the data to propagate
and why is it harder to propagate what's
in the payload what are we moving around
here it's the most efficient way to
garner proof you can inherit that proof
effortlessly and in a very compressed
Burkle root get manner whatever the you
know that the method of proofing is then
why have all that extra overhead well if
you make the argument that it's
relevant to buy Bitcoin or high volume
transactions I'm sorry bubble gum was
Bitcoin or a cup of coffee you know
that's obviously the debate that's going
on now and I don't know that I'm
smart enough to decide what's best I
can simply say have i've got a bias
based on a passion for proof and if the
cleanest and most efficient way to
garner proof is by making the payload as
small as feasibly possible so it can
propagate the quickest on lining to mine
then you know then i would go let's go
smaller let's not go bigger  let's
bring more players into the space let's
make the propagation faster that
would lend itself to decentralization
etc so that's all I would want to add in
regards to the block size because you
know when we open the conversation we
talked about not picking turf forest so
probably a disclaimer we need to put out
there it's a passion about you know is
can you perform efficient proof while
also handling high-volume transactions
so we're willing to let the market
decide that and willing to live with
with whatever the result is an adapt
you've been adopted adapt you that





**Christian Seberino:**
yes next fence so if I just for the
benefit of our audience if it correct me
if I'm wrong but you're describing the
two visions of Bitcoin the do you want
it to be a better credit card or do you
want it to be a better armored truck or
you know Fort Knox where security you
know it's dependable it doesn't change
very much or do you want that but you
know convenience speed and so but that's
of course the competing the debate
that's happening now and so I
could see why you guys would value the
the security that reliability more than
that that's that's that goes with your
happy 




**Justin Fisher:**
if you're going to be doing
high-volume transactions and your
your risk is a cup of coffee rather a
cup of coffee it overhead that we want
to put on the world's greatest proofing
utility that's ever existed and it's
probably one of the most profound
inventions in regards to I mean I didn't
really understand this when it hit me it
was pretty profound you know just the
idea of synchronizing separate nodes
that are actually hostile tori each
other but being able to agree upon that
information without having to trust
either side I mean that just has such
profound implications to me
and if you like the way I kind of like
and it is is that you've got this you
got this you know we've got a limited
resource we don't know how fast memory
can scale or bandwidth can scale we know
it's scales we know but we don't know
that it's going to keep up with the raid
if hyper transactions get adopted on
Bitcoin so again it's a market decision
I'm not say I'm certainly not smart
enough to be the one that to say you
should do this or you should do that I
think the economics of the market will
inevitably decide what's going to be
best but my bathroom personally is that
no ultimately I think the world I would
say it's more and more in this line
Christian I think the world could stand
to benefit tremendously from a proof
utility that is second to none and if
other chains can successfully provide
value for buying cups of coffee and do
so in an effective manner without
without stepping on the proof utility
but instead benefiting from the proof
utility well that's a better symbiotic
relationship then trying to stuff
everything into one pile in my opinion
but that's again that's yet to be
determined because one would argue that
well you know because in our situation
we're proposing the value still works
its way up to Bitcoin to incentivize the
miners so everyone talks about a
scaling problem with Bitcoin but Bitcoin
in my opinion it has zero scaling
problem it's actually unlimitedly
scalable the way it fits now because I
see the scale happening at the
transaction fee level not the block size
level I see proof is a rare commodity
there's only one set of hashing power in
the world that's that's Bitcoin and what
is the value of that well I mean you
would mean think about what we spend a
year on title insurance think about what
we spend a year in change of custody so
when you look at the profound
implications of how this is going to
impact our world I mean globally as a
society I mean with this technology
we've literally leveled up as long as we
remain as a species of law long as we're
governed by law having proof is a
cornerstone of that and I see proof as a
pillar so for me I see I think
things generally find a way to distill
themselves down to their essence and I
think proof as the utility will do such
a thing and if it was transactions that
brought us to the game and commerce or
cryptocurrency that brought us to the
game so be it i mean i would want to say
thank you and say maybe it maybe it
maybe it maybe it should be on something
light lightning with seg wit maybe it
should be off Cain completely and
the risk should be mitigated by securing
the height of your blockchain because
there's only so much room for proof at
our current rate because if you keep
making the block sizes larger you know
propagation is going to be it's going to
play a role I mean look there's nobody
that could argue the propagation is
faster with smaller payloads
it's irrefutable imagine




**Christian Seberino:**
 yes you know
you just something just click with me if
I could do your marketing for you just
kidding for this so
you can have it both ways the
conservative people that don't want to
change Bitcoin because it works and
let's not mess with it the people that
want the better credit card the better
whatever they could use your system or
something like it off chain and then so
you have the best of both worlds
you don't have to mess with the first
blockchain system that works so
wonderfully so that makes a lot of sense




**Justin Fisher:**
I mean it's the largest secure proof
agility in the world second to none and
if you're going to peel off half the
mining and say well we're all of it or
whatever I don't know what's going to
happen I you know we're going to follow
the longest chain obviously I'll let max
talk to that i won't i won't step over
my own intellect try to wander 
along but i think i expressed it i
mean you know proof is it's a pillar of
a society that's governed by law and
when you look at the benefits of proof
it's not something that should be taken
lightly and i almost feel like it was
originally kind of one of the
cornerstone elements it's very ethereal
nope intended it's hardly wrap yourself
around um but when you when you start to
connect with it you realize how
important and how it should I don't know
I think it's critical I think it's
obvious
when you go down these rabbit
holes you come up with stuff and you
start to adhere to principles and who
knows who's right and I I don't like to
make it about right wrong it's a passion
I'm passionate about it I want to
protect that utility and ultimately I
think the world is going to have the
most efficient utility available and I
hope it's Bitcoin 






**Christian Seberino:**
max I have a tech
question for you I made so just been
talked about the trust lyst nature of
Bitcoin gets altcoins that use your
system the proof of proof is it also
trustless or does it require a
federation to manage the writing for the
Bitcoin watching 




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
yes good question is
that there's absolutely no Federation
anyone just like Bitcoin mining anyone
can you know why hardware set it up and
start mining no one needs to know need a
license from Bitcoin they don't need
anyone to agree that they should do they
need anyone to be voting for them or
anything so too is the case with proof
of proof you know any any proof of proof
minor can come along and perform proof
proof publications and secure and absorb
watching without any anybody's
permission they can join and leave it
will at home it's no one you can be
totally anonymous with it you even have
to have a public identity with anything
other than an address to get paid for so
it's very similar to Bitcoin mining
that regard anyone can join anyone can
leave and then everyone can see the work
that other people are doing on the
blockchain




**Christian Seberino:**
 I'm sure a lot of people are
going to love to hear that your system
is also trust with now if i understand
correctly so the value proposition of
restock you get all this cool stuff but
you have to accept the Federation now
could they possibly use your proof of
proof to avoid the Federation and not
say something about that you know
anybody stuck





**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 yes poof of proof is a
consensus protocol so they're certainly
in a plane we do plan to work with root
stock in the future and they could
easily adopt their technology it
wouldn't remove the need for the
Federation for the 28 egg between the
currency
proof of proof is a means of
establishing maintaining consensus over
your blockchain it doesn't help with
Inter blotchy and communication of you
know like movement of funds or something
that would be a different case a
rootstock would certainly drop the
technology rootstock as it exists today
and is you guys emerged mining with
Bitcoin and so they can strap through
the crews on top of it get more security
through it avoiding the concerns with
some you know opportunity cost of
attacking your network and then the the
Federation of tokens the movement
between age for the side chain would
have to be solved either with continuing
to use these federated or semi saturated
solution or giving additional op codes
and functionality added to Bitcoin to
enable some more such and functionality
on Bitcoin side the



**Christian Seberino:**
 hard part basically



**Maxwell Sanchez:**
basically is
 yes there's a lot of
ideas in the states for how to do side
chains there's a lot of really exciting
work on there was a project called drive
chain which is really interesting they
do all at some level require that either
there's some former Federation or they
give the onus validation to Bitcoin
miners and have Bitcoin miners similar
in the way of merged mining they have
Bitcoin miners who are tracking a
network and all accepting or declining
things that occur on bitcoins based on
state that other network so without
additional changes which would require
hard fork to Bitcoin actual truly trust
was permission was decentralized side
chains that don't require any sort of it
mall involvement of Bitcoin miners or a
federation or anything are pretty much
impossible 





**Christian Seberino:**
okay all right now if I may
it's with you guys I'd like to move
on to so I think people now have an idea
that what what these altcoins could not
do is use your technology to to write
state information to Bitcoin but can you
can we now talk in a little bit more
detail of how what you call proof of
proof mining works now that we have the
big picture 






**Maxwell Sanchez:**
sure so a proof of proof
miner is a
taking what we're calling state data
which on a proof-of-work blockchain say
for example ethereum classic it would be
a block etter enough data to validate
that there is it ethereum a valid block or
Finland did a lot of work to pretend
they had two bottle blonde you're taking
that data that state data and they're
putting it on bitcoin and actually we're
building what we're calling the Vera
blockchain which is a aggregation
layer between other block chains and
Bitcoin it makes it easier to adopt
publishing data to bitcoin is a little
bit difficult and that you're limited
generally speaking to 80 bytes in off
return you can of course chain most
whopper turns together and get really
fancy but um there's it's also very
expensive as Bitcoin transaction fees
continue to rise so we're building an
aggregation layer where block chains can
actually do proof approve to Vera block
and then Vera block this proof of proof
to Bitcoin and so blockchains can do it
directly can do it through us we're
making and rolling out a set of tools
and make it super easy to adopt
and add onto existing blockchain
projects and those would use the Vera
block blockchain for that security it
also provides intermediate security to
them because they're black does have
some improvement work as well and so we
get into that a little bit more people
are interested but fundamentally the
idea of proof of proof is to take data
from a blockchain you want to secure
state data that can be validated like a
blockhead or one case of proof of stake
a block header plus some additional
information that essentially proves
their state something like the hash of a
transaction that they're using that
should exist in the UT XO before it
consumes take age or something like that
all of that data whatever's needed to
validate that there's a plausible block
on the blockchain kind of like SPV level
access take that publish it to Bitcoin
and then create a construct a proof of
that publication that's going and
return that to the subordinate network
and that gives that that auxiliary
network arm the what would effectively
announce the SPV level knowledge of
bitcoin where they can fax bitcoin
consensus they have all the Bitcoin
headers needed to do so all right
someone provides evidence of a longer
Bitcoin chain
they can validate that longer chain
instead and validate their data against
it 




**Christian Seberino:**
okay I'm not going to say so I
presume if the way your system works in
different altcoins can decide what how
many transactions go into every right
every proof on a bit put the coin chain
and that correct and you basically make
a hash of all of it a nice tiny
hash and that's what gets written




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 pretty
much the baby you're writing is what
you're doing when you're pushing proof
mining is you are securing existing
blocks on this important or the
auxiliary network you're taking you know
block 1000 which just came out and a
regular proof approve our proof of work
or proof of stake minor created this
block that has a bundle transactions and
you're validating that block to Bitcoin
and so the idea being if that block is
ever challenged then bitcoin can be
referenced as the ultimate arbiter of
truth wait i just thought of something




**Christian Seberino:**
so what you're saying is the alt point
we'll still have a proof-of-work system
like bitcoin now your system makes it
more secure by leveraging the security
of bitcoin so why would an out point
need a proof-of-work system at all why
not junk it and rely completely on
your approval 



**Maxwell Sanchez:**
that's a really good
question and that sort of the idea of
chain BB in a nutshell was you know let
luck the people who are doing this proof
proof what we're going through the proof
that we're didn't exist and shame to be
but we're calling through people doing
that let's let them assemble two blocks
to UM their ends up being some game
theory issues that the blockchains that
we secure still need to establish
immediate consensus they need a way to
actually create blocks and on a
short-term agree to those blocks and
then what we provided that long range
protection you know you won't get forked
back an hour a day a week a month a year
at home so they need that immediate or
intermediate consensus where they can
have the network agree you a block
temporarily before it gets elevated up
to Bitcoin the issue with having
and the thing is a lot of proof to
proof miners who are all working
separately none of them are you know
each other and necessarily er work
together they're all publishing the same
data to Bitcoin so they're all taking
that same last walk 1000 on the
auxiliary chain and they're putting that
data on Bitcoin the same data and
they're duplicating each other's efforts
similar to mining everyone's mining a
similar set of transactions here you're
securing the same block and then miners
of course you're mining on top of
generally speaking they're all mining on
top of the same block so they're
validating that block by doing 




**Christian Seberino:**
so you
would still have you interesting so you
have competing miners all writing to the
to the the blockchain as a Bitcoin blockchain
so you have redundancy then that's



**Maxwell Sanchez:**
right there's a tendency and then
it also makes that if someone's building
an attacking chain they would have to
also do those publications in broad
daylight so everyone would see they're
building a chain before they released
their fourth but what's really cool
is that with that sort of the system you
have a separation of power where the
ability to decide what transactions get
into the network is separate from the
ability to secure that decision oh so
miners traditional miners prefer to be
proof of stake miners whatever have you
traditional consensus mechanisms the
block creators block formers in that
protocol whether it be miners with a six
or proof of stake they are bundling
those transactions and there's no way
for a network to for everyone on network
to agree that this should be the next
block other than someone saying this is
the next block and I could work to prove
so you know like all the nodes on the
Bitcoin network have a similar but
slightly different men pool their
different transactions can pull
different relay rules there's no way for
them to all create the same block
deterministically and then publish that
blog they need someone else to create
that block in a means that everyone can
agree on and entrust and validate like
proof award and then they can all do
that duplication of work once the blocks
already created like what are we
on top of existing consensus



**Justin Fisher:**
 yes the
blockchain whatever whatever
even remove the word blockchain from the
equation whatever you do to which he
consensus is your business we're not
we're just taking your block change
state data post consensus and then we're
going to publish it in a game of five
banner to the Bitcoin block chain 4 1st
block height from where you've reached
consensus is that is that a fair summary
match




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 yes we don't replace consensus we
fortify it for your existing consensus
continues as normal and then we make it
you have to you establish content with
yourself and then we make sure that
consensus is maintained by using
publications to Bitcoin 




**Christian Seberino:**
yes that's
that's great so it's almost like
insurance just just to make people happy
and sleep well at night they can go do
their whatever they want their new group
of steak algorithm or alternate proof of
work and then use your system just so
they maybe people could do some issues
that happens that they can do some stuff
in the short term but you provide a
ceiling they can't mess it up more than
a certain number 



**Justin Fisher:**
exactly 




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
it's exactly so
you have a guarantee that you know this
block chain cannot work back more than
say an hour or whatever based on the
properties of the system and the the
kind of aggressiveness of the proof of
proof that they're using in whatever but
you can have that assurance where you
say you know we know as a fact that
there's no way for consensus to ever be
challenged on this block and we know
everything in there is completely
finalized short of Bitcoin itself having
a change in consensus where it's just
one doesn't change consensus we know
this block on our network will not
change 




**Christian Seberino:**
okay Justin 



**Justin Fisher:**
so if a block chain
is Tom it may be it traditionally may be
vulnerable to an attack because there's
a they're using it hashing algorithm
where there's an opposing network that
you same algorithm and they would want
to then attack the smaller ashing chain
they their d incentivized to do so now
because they're only going to be able to
hit at best they could just like disrupt
the chain but they couldn't roll it
backwards or undo any transactions or
modify the chain but their d incentivize
to take that hashing power they're
better off mining the network that's
paying them that through somebody else's
network it's just incentivization in
that case no value







**Christian Seberino:**
 yes so far the
further
benefit of the audience if I could try
to make a simple analogy tell me if you
like this so if I believe when there's a
forest fire the the fireman can burn
a ring around it right basically and so
then they go and try to put out the fire
inside the ring but at so worst-case
scenario the fire will burn everything
inside the ring but it can't leave that
that burn ring so there's a there's a
limit to the damage that can be done so
well you're what you're doing is kind of
like the burn ring would you agree with
that




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 yes they did a good analogy we can
you know Mark a certain block and people
can look at it and say you know there's
no way for consensus to be challenged
here but loss after we'll get that same
protection in the future but we have
this kind of moving that same kind of
burning idea of you know we know exactly
if anything were to be reversed or
attack we know exactly what it would be
uh-huh at any point in time we know that
this can be attacked this can't be
attacked you know this block could be
challenged this block cannot be
challenged as part of the force can burn
what will try to stop it but report
certainly can't




**Justin Fisher:**
 and there's an
interesting paradox that are that
evolves from the idea if it's adopted or
people that use it the stronger Bitcoin
gets into better security that they
receive and then they're allowed to
focus on their product or service unless
on you know they can they can if they
can look at more efficient consensus
algorithms that are worthy of what
it is that they're trying to secure
these different block chains are going
to have different thresholds of pain for
what their level security needs to be
know if there can be a finite roofing
utility that people can subscribe to a
grid through 50 well on the more people
that subscribe the more you know the
better that becomes and so on because it
becomes or worth mining so that value
flows up to that proof chain and I'm
saying prove chain because you know I
don't know you know what if Bitcoin does
I don't know who knows but if right now
that's where the hashing power lives and
we'd want to tap that because its
benefit of proof to your your project or
not used specifically I made you clearly
so as
if it's adopted then it becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy in that sense
and that it allows blockchains to focus
on their product or service instead of
getting into debates about security or
centralization or trustless and
it kind of gets it just
wears you down and let's just focus on
solutions and then let the solutions
start to battle it out instead of
talking about no security as a kind of
an ad hominem argument in the sense to
the blockade




**Christian Seberino:**
 yes now if I could
just kitchen we can you address so I
think people have a little bit more of
the idea of the fine detail you want to
say something about the attack vectors
that you've considered I know in your
paper you mentioned you had thought of
some so that you've obviously done your
homework so why don't you talk about
that 




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
sure so there's kind of two
discussions here first of all the papery
mentioned if anyone wants to read
through to the white paper about 20
pages going to be good very calm
and download and look at it the attack
vectors against proof of proof are
primarily regarding failures and
consensus on Bitcoin side if the Bitcoin
fork occurs then of course the consensus
of the auxiliary chains is also
challenged although a fork in Bitcoin
does not mean that the auxiliary chains
of the fork it would only be if someone
were to actively attack them along with
their attack on Bitcoin so Bitcoin
fourth doesn't mean that our other
channel fork but it doesn't mean that on
jewelry chain may forecast that burn
circle so to speak because that burn
circle is defined by bitcoins consensus
and security 




**Christian Seberino:**
well now in fairness to you
guys if I could I so you basically said
that you're you're just being honest
you're just basically saying that your
security depends on Bitcoin security and
well you're just you're you if Bitcoin
has issues with their security you guys
might have issues but what but
that's I wouldn't know nobody would
expect otherwise 




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 so that'd be the main attack
vectors yeah Bitcoin Forks or what we
call it we call the master blockchain
whatever watching or securing to of that
does fortunate the consensus challenged
on it and you to suffer it consensus
challenge potentially or not necessarily
it would make it possible but it does
eat eat this coin forking in itself
doesn't cause you can fork but it that
is the way someone could fork your chain
past that burn circle so is that and
then there are others with primarily
issues regarding certain ways that proof
the proof could be implemented that
would be attackable one of those is that
if all you were publishing to Bitcoin or
to the master blockchain was say for
example to block hash rather than the
non rather than the header with you know
the non and the timestamp and everything
needed to validate that proof work is
just a hash then people can arbitrarily
I'll reduce space in your system by
pretending that a fork is occurring when
it's not actually occurring because they
could Pogo make publish bogus data that
makes it look like they've created
dollar chain when they have them
don't let me again with that is a spill
proof in a way where the data
you're publishing can be validated as
valid between the rules of your
immediate consensus on your auxiliary
watching before  take whatever you're
using





**Christian Seberino:**
 so did you it is one of the points
you're making that it's up to the alt
coin to decide what to write to the
Bitcoin blockchain but if they don't
write enough information then they could
be in trouble so it's that is that
correct that what you're saying 





**Maxwell Sanchez:**
right so
it most of the issues with the
proof of proof protocol would be in if
you implemented certain things wrong
these are attack vectors I could come
and then we have you know ways you know
a recommendation for how to manage risk
best practices and what we're building
with them what we're going to be rolling
out is a ver block network that allows
that aggregation layer and then
libraries that make it really easy to
interface with it and inherit that
security and so those libraries will of
course use the best practices and if you
implement them correctly according to
specifications
this would not be an issue at all 





**Christian Seberino:**
you'll
help people to use your technology
correctly of course





**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 mostly
attack vectors just come down to either
Bitcoin being attacked itself for
implementation if the implementation is
incorrect in certain ways that may not
be obvious when designing it that there
could be issues that evolved out of that
sure final consensus issue would be
that with proof of proof there is if you
are very quiet block chain and
nobody's doing proof approve obviously
not getting the security but your chain
is actually technically at more risk
because someone could create an
alternative chain and you prove the
proof to overcome your chain with less
raw worth so if you're a blockchain
doesn't have at least some very
minor consistent proofing and you do
open yourself up to more attack them if
you didn't have proof approve didn't
have any sort of right at all minimal
proofing you know one person is doing it
every hour or two then you're safe but
if they absolutely band approve the
proof but they felt like implemented in
the protocol then it does create a
security risk I was gonna improve
recovery 




**Christian Seberino:**
yes if you wouldn't have said
that I that was that idea came to my
mind when you are listing a possible
attack vector so the analogy would be of
course if if you make your burn ring
right 2 big then the fire has the
potential to do a lot more damage than
if you made it really close to the fire
so don't be it's a mistake to make
it too big




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 it's a great tool but you
just got to use it correctly and so if
I'm use the tool correctly if you have
here just like Bitcoin a stick one too
many miners it would be very insecure in
fact it wouldn't even run so too
if you don't have proof of proof miners
in your network you are vulnerable
and if you implement proof of proof
visited sting shin is that is the
only case where by having proof of proof
you are made less secure is by having it
if not using it on it would be the
danger 



**Christian Seberino:**
so okay now Justin do you want to
add anything to that 




**Justin Fisher:**
that was pretty
good summary I mean I don't think I'd be
adding anything of value if I added
but I I think he said it said it pretty
well though well you know the one area
that I mean maybe it's premature that as
he was talking I was thinking about
because we talked about Vera block you
know if in theory proof of proof is
right and it's adopted and it's erased
then seemingly if it's writing to the
world's best proofing network that's
available seemingly that proofing
network would need to have the smallest
block size feasibly possible to provide
security that's not a lot of real estate
so the fees to get into that real estate
would seemingly be very high so
aggregation of groups first proof
proofing would definitely become it
would be in vogue and it would be an
essence st to provide the most efficient
means for proofing so you know we're
going to build out Vera block we think
it's going to have a place we think that
it's got value and we think it's the
most efficient way to write to the
world's greatest proofing utility
whatever that plans to be and inevitably
if black change cuties proof proof
independently and you know they see
value in it that's great too because
it's still serving the greater good as
far as supporting the world's greatest
proofing utility and inevitably if those
fees become cost prohibitive for a blockchain
because it's proof of proof is
successful then you know Vera block is
readily available as a truly trust lyst
decentralized permission list and
transparent solution for doing said
proof of proofs in other words Vera
block is a gateway to the proofing
Network providing a very or the most
efficient way to do the proofing
it's an aggregation so and ultimately
it's life or death is going to depend on
those blockchains or utilities that its
services so you know it's a Bible
people for the people play inevitably we
want to build it launched just set it
free and see where it goes but that's
that's kind of the grand vision so
whether it's proof of proof or Vera
block you know we think there's value in
adopting Vera block out of the gate
because if
if in theory things play out and you run
lines down the down the road inevitably
roads are all going to lead back to you
know trying to do a single merkel route
into the Bitcoin blockchain to secure a
great deal secure a block change




**Christian Seberino:**
 yes now
at one point like if I could just see
your healthy do your marketing one more
time and tell you chief so just let me
just emphasize that you're not
necessarily stuck or wedded to Bitcoin
right if some other systems are also
provide security you're perfectly happy
and able to switch to that other one is
that correct 




**Justin Fisher:**
ok can I answer that max I
would say for me personally
philosophically I would I would say that
I would consider myself a proof-of-work
maximalist in the sense of providing
proof I'm not saying that that is the
end-all be-all for consensus i think
that there's creative um simply plenty
of solutions that used to speak or
whatever whatever those consensus
mechanisms mechanisms are I don't think
that they can truly have the same
properties that proof of work has proof
of work has its own inherent properties
and if those properties those intangible
properties that that I'm personally a
maximalist for and I want to move value
up to the world's best of utility and if
if bitcoin is the best form of proof of
work to date and that's what we'll use
it's something else tomorrow we'll use
that we're not work we're
blockchain agnostic but we're proof
centric 



**Christian Seberino:**
okay yes let me unless you guys
have any other comments why don't we why
don't we wind things down by and kind of
moving more to the discussion towards
ethereum classic so you guys are ethereum
classic fans like me you believe in
their philosophy their vision so would
you like to maybe say something about
what you could offer if you're in
classic now



**Justin Fisher:**
 action


**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 sure i'll put pretty
simply what we'd like to do is work with
the community and be if you're in
classic developers
to put together a testament that has
ethereum classic functionality with
proof of proof security demonstrate it
show it off see people like it see if it
everything works and it's a good fit for
the system and its blossom pretty well
adopting proof approved does require
during the hard work of the auxiliary
watching because you are changing the
way consensus is established and so it's
the kind of thing that since you guys
have some hard Forks plan in the future
for things like your monetary policy arm
Gary's change to the platform it's not
hard for it but you're also doing the
code rewrite and Scala it'd be a good
time to add any of those hard for
moments you know it proof approve ends
up being something that the xperia
munity the fear in class community wants
to adopt and see live on the main chain
those source would be a great way to put
that additional functionality and
without causing any more disruption to
the network then the fork was already
going to create just with you know
switching of your new software and
getting in one organized so janitor we
are but gorgeous 






**Justin Fisher:**
yes I am I've
been watching ethereum classic I have
an interest in the project I think
that's gotta smart group of people spend
some time speaking with Charles and
Carlo and smart guys and I like some of
the things you've done as far as capping
the emission rate I like some of those
ideas but I think there's an
interesting opportunity here and you
know when I when I think about
differentiating oneself and standing out
and showing boldness and showing its
kind of its thinking different if you
will you look ethereum and you look
at Bitcoin and I'll say ethereum classic
I mean if you're in classic feels kind
of funny I feel like I should just say
ethereum and we're did but I won't go
there right now but are so for the sake
of being clear if you're going to look
ethereum classic or
cerium original I look at Bitcoin there
was always this kind of this adversarial
relationship and I see it is completely
unnecessary i think it's
void of truly being constructive so when
i look at to me fundamentally what makes
bitcoin great proof and I looking you
know what makes what got me interested
in the ethereum to begin with you know
smart contracts and the you know the the
virtual machine this cubed virtual
machine if you all I mean if you can
take the chocolate of Bitcoin and put it
with the peanut butter of ethereum
that's a really profound idea and it
allows the debate about your mining and
the ashtray and security it puts allow
that to rest and allows you to focus on
the products and services and really
building out applications and solutions
and it says a lot about the character of
the community because they're saying you
know we're not afraid of Bitcoin we see
its value and proof you'd be stupid to
do that so it shows a lot of character
and I think that could be a unique
opportunity to really you know if
you're in classic is one of the big boys
and for one of the big boys to take a
step forward and embrace an idea like
this it's a groundbreaking idea
and it could really do a lot for the
community and the interest in people
coming in and I think there's a lot of
smart money on the side they could come
into the space because they say you know
what that's really interesting Bitcoin
in a theory i'm working together it's a
profound idea and i think it makes a
grand statement for those who are on the
outside who don't live in the space in a
daily basis like we do to kind of say
wow it's you know it's kind of like you
know it's like wow they're working
together and they're benefiting from
each other's strengths



**Christian Seberino:**
 yes i can't
really think anything away so not you
right if they presumably let's say they
added it to a future hard court that
we're going to happen anyway it would in
no way would it remove from a security
so you wouldn't cost anything offense
but adds extra 



**Justin Fisher:**
it's no cost because
here's the way here's and that's
an interesting question you know cuz
sounds great what do I
what does it cost well it's
relative because you're going to
be diverting a portion of the coin base
to proof of proof miners to do the
proofing on your behalf but in exchange
you're going to inherit all that hashing
power instantly for a fraction of the
cost of what was spent to do the hash
for you now all of a sudden the guy
who's mining maybe he's not getting
as much coin but the coin he's getting
could seemingly be more valuable
because it's more secure the people
using the network are going to get more
security and then there's one area we
really haven't really touched on but
it's an exciting area as well the
exchanges are going to get
a set of metrics and that's one of the
reasons that we think Vera block is
going to have value it because max has
got some wonderful ideas and he's
working closely with right now bit
tricks and there's other exchanges on
boarding as well in that they can
provide early attack detection in a set
of other metrics that allow exchanges to
be able to react more quickly and it
gives more value to the entire ecosystem
because when security comes value
because know again that ring of fire
gets tighter and tighter and tighter
more compact and efficient so yeah the
idea of ethereum classic reaching out
and seeing the value of bitcoins proof
as a form of security to protect
themselves from bigger hashing power
that might want to prey on them I know
I think it's a pretty
compelling idea and I think it's a great
story and it's a great narrative to
those who are maybe thinking about
coming into the space I think it says a
lot about the character with your in
classic 



**Christian Seberino:**
yes wonderful 



**Maxwell Sanchez:**
if you're
in classic is also like the perfect
example of the blockchain where proof of
proof makes sense because you know as
you guys become more successful and get
a higher market cap and edge up closer
to  your procedures more of a
threat and you know they have an
incentive to attempt to disrupt the
network and so you're at a position
where there is a network that has the
same hashing algorithm they have a lot
of hash power and you know there is that
that conflict between you know if you're
in classic encroaching on the value of
cerium or whatever and so it's a really
good it's a very large blockchain it's
a very
unique case where you know there is sort
of a need for that protection as you
guys get more successful and start
building more value and if you're in
potentially see some sort of threat or
the monitors with your entities and sort
of threat 


**Christian Seberino:**
so yes I think it's a
very nice



**Maxwell Sanchez:**
 interplay between the two
projects




**Christian Seberino:**
 so if I was to try to summarize
our discussion the highlights some of
the points for the listeners so you're
basically providing a much greater
security for non Bitcoin blockchain and
you provide it in a essentially costless
manner that too and for these alternate
coins and you thought about the attack
vectors you have a paper people can read
that spells it all this out and so
there's plenty of information plenty of
thought went into this and there's a lot
of value in your idea is that
correct would you want to add anything
to that 




**Maxwell Sanchez:**
yeы and we've gotten some peer
review on the white paper there's been
very positive feedback on it we're
working at block labs who will have
additional help and resources from them
as well with building out the technology
and getting it adopted and but if
anyone wants to look into the technology
anymore the websites up our there's a
white paper that explains it in
nauseating technical detail and if they
want a then clarified I'm always easy to
contact as well and I might be happy to
answer any questions people have about
the technology how it works clarifying
how blotching could adopt it or kind of
world office looks like any of that can
as more than welcome in my inbox so
unacceptable and open 



**Christian Seberino:**
Justin do you want
to add anything to that



**Justin Fisher:**
 well i mean
first foremost you know from this from
the onset of meeting with carlo in new
york um getting to meet Charles and now
yourself because following the community
striving to understand more about a
technical perspective for me at least I
have a background erstanding matches
deeply into the details you've already
been writing some code
well you know it's an honor I mean you
guys letting us on the show and voice
our ideas on giving us free marketing
which is yoga as far as sure what did
you call it your marketing advice or you
guys



**Christian Seberino:**
 yes charging for that 




**Justin Fisher:**
that's
pretty there's a clear value
there but you know that's obviously
everybody operating in a vacuum off your
struggles with that and sometimes get
another perspective and add an opinion
it's really helpful so if you want to
share some other stuff after the call
and we'd like to keep you involved in
our progress what we're doing you
know we're just honored and grateful
that you let us be a part of the show
and gave us an opportunity to present to
your community and our experience has
been second to none you guys been very
gracious community and we're just proud
to be part of it so thank you 



**Christian Seberino:**
all right
thank you guys also for a great
discussion I really appreciate it I will
definitely have to keep tabs on you guys
I'm sure you guys are going to do great
things and I'll be hearing about you in
the news maybe in the future who knows
so thank you guys again for coming
on and and that's it so I wish you guys
well and we'll keep in touch ok great
thank you take your Grecian if you are
passionate about anything related to
ethereum classic and you have
that's that leaking on show we're all
looking for interesting
