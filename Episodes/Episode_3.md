however what I really want to discuss
with everyone tonight is in reference to
the report  IOHK so thank you IOHK for
that Thank You Charles thank you IOHK
team everybody out there who worked on

of you don't know dash is another
blockchain cryptocurrency you guys can
check it out on coin market cap
somewhere around there if you want to
check that out so uh the report details
some of the pros cons and other stuff
that they have going on with that
governance treasury model it's a really
interesting piece that I suggest you
guys check out if you get a chance
thankfully tonight we have a really
great dash community member with us and
host of crypto holics joining us tonight
special guest bill Cassidy how you doing
bill what's going on 

**Bill Cassidy:**
what's up I'm gonna
really thank you for having me

**Carlo Vicari:**
 so he's
done a lot of great work with the Dash
community for everybody who's listening
um so bill how'd you get into blockchain
you know what would first got you
interested in this whole block chain
thing you know we've all got our story
on how we you know got in here and how
how we got started so I was just
wondering how you got started 

**Bill Cassidy:**
right so is it was around the end of
2013 when I first got into crypto I
think the Bitcoin price was exploding
and I had her
about Bitcoin before but I just I wasn't
really i didn't have the technical
know-how to understand how it worked or
to get into it and at this point it was
pretty clear that I wasn't going to be
doing any Bitcoin mining and I didn't
want to purchase any Bitcoin for twelve
hundred dollars so i just started
looking for other projects and uh

**Carlo Vicari:**
interesting

**Bill Cassidy:**
 i found yeah I found ripple
and I think the thing that drew the
thing that drove me to ripple is they
were doing this thing called the world
community grid initiative and basically
anybody could use their computing power
to process this data that the world
community grid provided and so if you
had a stronger computer you could
process more data and ripple labs they
set up a team on this world community
grid thing and they were rewarding users
for pointing their computing power at
this grid as I was doing that I was
doing that for a few months and i was
earning some XRP and i got bunch of my
friends involved and hmm ripple ended
that initiative and I was kinda I kind
of realized how how lame ripple was okay
at that point too so I got out of ripple
and I started looking for other projects
and I found dark coin and I really
jumped right in and
I started
volunteering my time

**Carlo Vicari:**
 that's way back
believe grand 

**Bill Cassidy:**
yes this was around March
2014 when I when I joined the dark coin
community and I jumped in like I
was saying and I just I just started
volunteering my time and I started
making like tutorial videos and writing
guides i think i did 25 help videos in
total and they're actually still up
there on the Dash youtube channel i
wrote a few guides and i started doing
my podcasting for Dash actually i
started my first podcast for dark
calling it was called the the daily dose
of dark and i did fifty five episodes in
a row for five days in a row and i ended
up getting shingles literally saw
I quit that in

**Carlo Vicari:**
 holy cow


**Bill Cassidy:**
 yes around
eight months ago I realized that Dash
didn't have a public slack you know and
I had pushed them to open one and they
never really wanted to so I just took it
upon myself to open a dash slack and I
started inviting all the community
members and the slack grew to about 900
people in eight months or seven months
or so 

**Carlo Vicari:**
yes I say slacks pretty awesome


**Bill Cassidy:**
yes Lex pretty cool you know my
involvement with Dash 0 is kind of like
I'm very vocal you know I'm
outspoken and I'm not afraid to say
what's on my mind and I'm not afraid to
say if I think something's wrong or you
know and so I the Dash core team they
there was a little bit of discontent
with the slack because they realized
that we were actually gaining power know
when they saw this and they started
labeling me actually the the community
and some of the core members they
labeled me like a troll my own
community that I was apartment they
would call me a troll yeah they even
made a meme they called us me my cohorts
that they claim that there was only five
of us that would say these things he's
outspoken things and they called us the
five guys someone even made a one of
those Hitler videos about it it's pretty
funny i'll send egos Annie here Hey
sure wait the sugar


**Christian Seberino:**
 so you
may have heard everybody some people i
don't know about everybody but Zcash
people are talking about that and so
privacy we talked on on the last show
how that's like the the next flavor of
the month and so i was curious since
you've been involved with a coin adult
coin that has privacy what that was like
what i mean by that is big like new
people or when you
explain to people when they go oh
privacy wow you guys must all be drug
dealers that's bad well just curious the
social the acceptance of how that played
out thanks model

**Bill Cassidy:**
 I don't think it was
necessarily so much the the technology
that scared people but when the name was
dark coin that was definitely a big
turn-off to people and I had when we
were doing the rebranding from dark coin
to Dash I actually emailed Evan Duffield
the lead developer for dash asking him
like because I was against it at first
and I was like why are you doing this
man like this is not a good idea like I
don't think he should be doing this and
his response to me was that they were
actually being investigated by euro pool
or whatever so there are some
investigations going on and you
know it does have like a negative
connotation to it which kind of sucks
because that's what drove me to two dash
was the privacy aspect but to be
honest likein my previous
interview I had Ricardo swag me and Gary
Lee from Zcoin and Ricardo from enero
and one of the one of the points we made
was that like if 

**Carlo Vicari:**
great show by the way I
listened to that


**Bill Cassidy:**
 thank you if if the
private if the privacy is not enabled by
default and nobody's going to use it and
that's the truth I was with Dash for two
years and I literally probably used the
mixing the mixing technology it's called
dark send I used it three times two or
three times


**Carlo Vicari:**
 you know I actually have a
comment about that I was listening and I
agree to to some extent I think if you
have something like mineiro that's
inherently you know private no matter
what you do you're obviously going to
have a lot more private transactions
because one hundred percent of them will
be but let's just say hypothetically
Dash or another crypto or blockchain
became an absolute development
powerhouse and it was you know in every
country all over the world and it had
like you know 600 billion market cap or
something
so I think as a community grows as the
use of something grows so will the
community that wants to use it for
something anonymously oh good eventually
you know it's just I i think if you guys
keep growing there will be a user
base that uses it for that sort of thing
potentially 

**Bill Cassidy:**
yes


**Carlo Vicari:**
 that's just kind of
kind of my thoughts on I could be way
off base cuz there's a lot that I don't
know obviously now I was thinking I had

**Christian Seberino:**
a question so are you saying that just
by taking the word dark out of the name
all of a sudden now you privacy is okay
and nobody is going to investigate you
anymore is that minus

**Bill Cassidy:**
 not necessarily I
mean I think they could investigate you
either way especially if they they know
about the technology i just i think the
dark was just yeah just serene unwanted
attention that we didn't need you know I


**Carlo Vicari:**
think about it Christian
it's you know it's regulators in an
office somewhere who knows where
sometimes a rebrand is all you need to
just get out of the radar if you know
blockchain is barely on the radar or
somewhat radar I also think that


**Bill Cassidy:**
 I think Dash rebranded also not
only because of that but they have like
a plan to do more than just privacy and
to be all right my belief is that
they're moving away from privacy like I
feel like in one to two years Dash isn't
even gonna be pushing their their
privacy technology


**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes I think 
it wouldn't be something they it looks
like it's not gonna be something they
push but it'll just be a useful feature
that say you know less than ten percent
of the users used but it's their choice
to use it I guess

**Bill Cassidy:**
 yes


**Carlo Vicari:**
 if they have it
on at home

**Bill Cassidy:**
 for sure

**Christian Seberino:**
 on well but I have
another question can you say
something about how the the privacy
works the mixing what you defer not to
get too technical but can you somehow
for people i don't know can you say
something about that



**Bill Cassidy:**
 right so it's
kind of it's based off coin join but
it's a stripped-down version
of coin
apparently they've improved the coin
join like immensely and I'm not a
developer so I can only say what
I've been told I can't actually look at
this code and vet it and make sure that
that's true you know but basically you
just click a button in the wallet and
the cutie wallet and it says start dark
said mixing and wait what you're doing
is you're basically mixing your coins
like we have other users and they're all
like specific denominations of like
point 0 1 point 1 110 and then 100 and
that's about as technical as I can get
no


**Carlo Vicari:**
 I think I get
 it what are you


**Christian Seberino:**
 my
house is it liked or that the
reason everybody doesn't do it or it's
not the default is because it slows it
down transactions

**Bill Cassidy:**
 its it takes too long
so you can't send a private
transaction without mixing so you
have to mix your coins before you can
send a private transaction so you
mix your coins and like if you do mixing
right now let's say you mix a thousand
Dash right if you mix a thousand Dash
that's literally gonna take like 24
hours and so you know yeah like if you
don't want to spend them right away
that's fine you know you're not gonna
spend them right away or anything you
can do some mixing and have them for
later but in today's day and age people
people want instant you know people want
straight immediately 

**Christian Seberino:**
yes
understand


**Bill Cassidy:**
 if you had a
choice to use a mixer or something
that's just default defaulted on privacy
you know I feel more people are
gonna choose the default privacy method


**Carlo Vicari:**
agreed yes i see so well I guess that's
more like dark coin past so let's talk
about you know Dash current dash future
type stuff yes since you know I
think it was a great rebrand by the way



**Bill Cassidy:**
 yes I think in the end it
worked out over all

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes i agree so
what do you have going on currently and
you
no the ETC community was talking you
know when this whole if you're in
classic thing for started Dash came up a
lot is an interesting governance and
treasury model and IOHK way has looked
into it what what do you guys have going
on currently as far as different
proposals and what do you maybe have
planned in the future what are your some
of your thoughts


**Bill Cassidy:**
 well honestly like to
tell you the truth this happened
just pretty recently I'm like kind of
going through a breakup with the Dash
community so at this specific time in
moment I really could not tell you
exactly what's going on it's been about
about two months since i've done my
breakup with Dash and I'll getting a
little background on that it's
just I was feeling I volunteered a
lot of time to this project in two years
you know and more I went to the detainee
event in San Francisco I've I demoed the
soda machine I paid for my own ticket i
paid for my own hotel room has never
offered any kind of money or
compensation for anything and i was just
kind of feeling really underappreciated
by the Dash core team and actually the
Dash community too and it wasn't really
good i wasn't getting the recognition i
deserved so two months ago I sold all my
Dash and converted about eighty percent
of my holdings into Bitcoin and I put
the rest into other projects that I
believe in 

**Carlo Vicari:**
cool so yes I guess some
I didn't necessarily mean what do you
have going on in Dash specifically but I
know you've been in
blockchain for a long time I know you
you're involved in a lot of things you
got a lot of great community members
that you're in touch with and speaking
with frequently so what do you see
currently that's cool what do you think
that's cool in the future and stuff like
that

**Bill Cassidy:**
 right so I actually have two
projects that I'm working on and I think
they're really cool so i'm going i'll go
ahead and plug those real fast and up
rig is this whole scenario that i
just explained this kind of ties into
what I'm working on so the definitely
like the Dash slack that i created since
I was feeling underappreciated i pivoted
that into a crypto chat room and I
named it crypto chat and so basically we
are moving away from slack in general I
mean I'm still using slack but we're now
using a platform called riot and it's
built on a the framework called matrix
matrix org and it's very similar to a
slack but it's open source and we
can run it on our own server so we don't
need to trust slack or you know rely on
slack and 

**Carlo Vicari:**
right 

**Bill Cassidy:**
we can build bridges
between crypto chat between the channels
on my chat room and other slack so
for instance I did that with with you
guys we built a bridge between the
ethereum classic slack we we built the
channel in there and we called it crypto
chat and then we built the bridge from
there over to my crypto chat room so now
everybody that talks in that ethereum
classic channel you can see that over
in the crypto chat Channel and vice
versa as well

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes thanks for
help setting that up by the way

**Bill Cassidy:**
 yes for
sure so crypto chats kind of my main
project and i have a few partners
working on that with me and then my
other project is crypto holics and it's
basically my podcast that I'm working
on right now I'm trying to grow it into
a little bit more for instance I
posted your guys's last podcast on there
a link to it and I'm trying to just get
all types a different
content on there from other people so

**Carlo Vicari:**
absolutely yes the interview you
did with Charles was really good a
lot of great percentage but that was


**Bill Cassidy:**
 a
big hit I feel like Charles had that
on his chest and he was just ready to
let loose with him

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes that was that
was a good one 

**Christian Seberino:**
 second for Bill I'm
shelter you're obviously very
dedicated and very passionate so what
was it initially and currently that
drove that passion and level of
commitment to like you said you pay
for the plane ticket to go and demo
something and all the effort that you
did you know


**Bill Cassidy:**
 I never really worried
about the money or anything I don't I'm
not like I didn't want money back or I
think my passion came from I guess
building building a reputation really a
for two years you know you join this
industry as a new guy and it's like you
don't even want to make a comment on a
reddit post you know you're gonna get
yelled at or you gonna get called stupid
or whatever so I think at first my goal
was to just build my reputation and I'm
gonna get some recognition nothing I way
it was working for a while you know i
knows meeting a lot of people and


**Christian Seberino:**
 so
wasn't liking it I was guessing that
you were gonna say you had a mission to
give the world privacy or something like
that you know 


**Bill Cassidy:**
I'm a libertarian and
I do believe in freedom and privacy I
just I hate pushing like my agenda on
people I don't mind showing you or like
revealing some kind of technology to you
that could possibly help you I've
learned that trying to change people's
minds or trying to change people's ways
it's almost impossible  so I 
wasn't I'm not here to like change the
world or


**Carlo Vicari:**
 I know well in some ways you
you are maybe you don't realize it but
this movement blockchain is still so
early even if you feel like you were
late to the party be joining it in 2013
in the grand scheme of it this is like
internet 19 maybe not even maybe not
even 1990 this could be like Internet
Protocol days this could be like 80s I
don't even know what it would be what do
you think Christian you know a lot of a
lot more about that than I do if you had
to put this on an Internet year where do
you think we are


**Christian Seberino:**
 yes maybe maybe that
about nine point ninety I think

**Carlo Vicari:**
yes I was kind of thinking the same
thing

**Bill Cassidy:**
 yesI missed that you know i
was born in 84 so I wasn't all right to
enjoy that experience so it is
really nice to be a part
this

**Christian Seberino:**
 yes now I hit beat you said you
you had you know your fan of privacy
and your libertarian somy sense was
so one way to push your views who said
you don't like pushing them you get into
politics and try to change the world
that way but it seems to me that with
blockchains you can advance your
political views without having if
politics isn't your thing you can do it
that way which is kind of fascinating
that geeks


**Carlo Vicari:**
know it's some very
interesting space and they're still I
mean if you're doing this crypt aholic
show this could end up being as the
space grows you know a ginormous show
you never know 

**Bill Cassidy:**
right it's cool because
it's giving us all this like it's given
us this opportunity here right i would i
would have never started a podcast or
anything if i wasn't involved in this
industry


**Carlo Vicari:**
yes so
I also wanted to talk a little bit
about I mean I know I know you're
just kind of just starting to part ways
with them but you do have a lot of
experience with them and you more
than anybody would know some of the pros
and cons of that Dash governance
treasury model and this is something
that a lot of people in the ethereum
classic community are interested in is
among other different governance
and treasury models that people are
talking about and looking into and
decentralized governance so if you could
tell us a little bit about kind of
what's going on with that and maybe if
you know from personal experience some
of the positives some of the negatives
and maybe even some negatives that you
know about that you have suggestions for
and you know we can talk about that and
kind of incorporate that into some of
our own proposals later on in the future
potentially


**Bill Cassidy:**
 yes so I was in all with
getting a couple proposals past the
first one I was involved with it was
called the Dash world evolution and it
was a marketing proposal and there's
this community member who came in and he
basically he wanted to do marketing for
Dash and he did it really

**Carlo Vicari:**
 I was gonna
say
if you could um if you could tell some
of the listeners out there that might
not know I'm just give them a brief
rundown of the Dash model as far as like
the super nodes and the proposals just
kind of briefly so that everybody
listening out there when we get into it
they'll know what you mean by the
proposals and the voting percentages and
stuff like that yep

**Bill Cassidy:**
 okay so anybody can
submit a proposal to the the Dash 
budget system and for example
everyone knows amanda b johnson she
submitted a proposal to do a show and
that's just an example and it passed and
she's getting paid to do her Dash
detailed show right now so basically you
you submit some commands in the command
line or you can there's a website you
can go to to submit a proposal it's
called osh central i think they
they help you lay it out so you submit
your proposal to the network and it it
goes to the network and the master knows
there's a few tools for master no donors
masternodes are basically regular nodes
like an in Bitcoin but you have to have
a collateral of one guys in Dash and if
you are a master node then you're you're
allowed to vote on budget proposals so
Amanda comes in submits her proposal to
the network and anybody who owns a
thousand Dash and is running a master
node can vote yes or on that proposal
or a sofa


**Carlo Vicari:**
 so it's someone that has like
a real stake in the currency or the
blockchain that's able to determine the
block trains future you can't just um
vote you know on whatever you want if
you have like one dash because you don't
have a enough steak to determine the
future of the blockchain so essentially
is that it

**Bill Cassidy:**
 exactly the minimum is 1,000
Dash so it's basically a thousand Dash
per vote 


**Carlo Vicari:**
so you pretty much get
people who really look into the
different proposals and I'm sure do a
lot of due diligence as far as what
what's going to be pushed forward not
necessarily that you don't have problems
but
you would probably have less problems
than if just everyone could vote I
imagine any way


**Bill Cassidy:**
 less problems because
there's probably less manipulation
possibly but there's more problems I
feel because you know those master node
owners a lot of them honestly just don't
care they just don't care and I really I
did everything I could in my power you
know I i was doing podcasts at the time
when the the budget system first came
out and i was i was interviewing
proposers you know people who were
submitting proposals I was interviewing
them about their proposals and
publishing these interviews so the
master node owners could get more
information in other ways you know I was
riding PDFs and just trying to get
people to vote but if you go look at
like the voting totals on a lot of these
proposals that are up there like voting
the voting percentage is very very low
right and that was one of the biggest
issues that


**Carlo Vicari:**
 I saw it's funny you mention
that because i read the IOHK breakdown
and that was one of the conclusions in
there as a one of the critiques was
about the lack of incentive for master
node participation so you know you
notice that well as well I guess so
that's

**Bill Cassidy:**
 what one of the issues one of the
issues with that too was that you know
there's a there's three whales that I
know of in Dash and whales as in I
know for sure that Evan Duffield owned
over 400 masternodes I know for sure
there's another whale and I'm not going
to mention his name but he owned over
600 masternodes when I know that there
was his buddy that the guy that owns six
hundred I know he had a buddy who owned
like 500 masternodes and the thing is
that these guys would also they would
never vote you know heaven wouldn't vote
the 600 the 500 guy wouldn't vote so
that's what like 1600 masternodes out of
30 something hundred high that never
voted I say so I think that having big
whales in this type of system it's bad
for two
reasons because a they can sway votes
and me they can not just not low and it
just it makes it look like nobody really
cares 

**Carlo Vicari:**
I see do you have any suggestions
or um thoughts on maybe how that can
be improved upon for you know the et Cie
community that's listening out there and
might pick up this discussion where we
leave off

**Bill Cassidy:**
 so myself and a couple
partners of mine when we had the slack
the slack room the Dash slack we
actually submit we actually submitted
our own proposal to to pay some of our
volunteers to create community
initiatives to fund the tip bought we
had a tip bought and a dashed it bought
and so the reason I bring that up
those because I told you Evan the lead
developer for Dash he he like never
voted on proposals uh he voted on our
proposal and he voted no with Fagin your
master notes and I was surprised I
was a very like really man like you do
not appreciate community initiatives
like what's going on here man and so
then the other guy the other whale voted
yes boom if you go look at this proposal
the slack proposal we actually had more
voter turnout than probably ninety
percent of the proposals on there and
the way that I did that was vocalizing
it you know if you're a person who
submits a proposal you've got to get
your ass out there and in every way any
way possible just try to get information
to a mean it's


**Carlo Vicari:**
 it's like the blockchain
version of knocking on doors that's
funny 

**Bill Cassidy:**
it's crazy you know we got we got
funded for two months the proposal was
set for three months right we we said it
for three months we got fall in it for
two months on the third month it gets
crazy like budgets pass on the six of
each month
or so around the six so towards the end
of the month like end of each month it
starts getting crazy in the chat rooms
on the forums people are yelling at each
other like arguing no you're like just
crazy my proposals better your sucks you
know and dude for like for four or five
days up until the last month of funding
for our dash purple or our slack
proposal we were like in in combat mode
just trying to rally votes man we
welcome like 

**Carlo Vicari:**
i don't know if you've ever
seen the funny videos of like crazy
parliament when they're really yelling
at each other for may be questioning
gelen you know something it's not it's
not like the the American Congress or
something you know they're jumping over
the bear the barriers do you don't swing
in at each other it's done that's how


**Bill Cassidy:**
 it
is man it's I swear then you know like
you everyone's posturing like no like
this proposal so
ultimately it sucks because ultimately
we got defunded and the reason we were
defunded was because uh Ryan Taylor the
he's like in charge of finances over a
dash he he took control of one of the
whales masternodes the the whale gave
him control of the masternodes and Ryan
Taylor up voted this proposal called
legal and they were getting legal advice
from these attorneys and then he
downvoted our proposal and he knocked us
out and that's one of the issues with
whales having too many votes you know
like it's is that really a decentralized
voting system right there you know when
one guy can sway the entire thing


**Christian Seberino:**
 I
should you say okay so you've mentioned
some of the issues with what you got
going right now distributing the funds
but I'm curious if you have any thoughts
if this process or a related process
would work with something even more
touchy like protocol changes if you're
you probably know about the
bait on changing the block size in
bitcoin land and the split that happened
and it was a theory minute ethereum
classic have you guys used this or a
similar model to debate discuss a
sensitive issues like like hard Forks
things like that

**Bill Cassidy:**
so
 in fact we did and
I think this was just for some PR buzz
you know but when the whole block sighs
debate and Bitcoin was going on Dash
actually voted to increase our block
size from whatever 11 whatever megabyte
to two megabytes or whatever and we
it passed with flying colors and that
one got a lot of voters to it passed but
then the question comes like how do you
force a developer to implement something
right you can't like I can't say 
you know let's say Evan voted no on that
proposal I don't know if you did or not
but let's say he did vote no on that
proposal but the proposal ended up
passing you know can-can the community
can the master don't know donors like we
can't hold him hostage until he
implements that change right he could
just quit he could just be like screw
you guys I'm out of here so how can
you so the fundings there the funding
model is there but the governance is not
there


**Christian Seberino:**
 yes I see this is a real
big open problem probably for a while
how to in a decentralized system how to
to deal with these really controversial
decisions that have to be made and I
don't know if anybody has the perfect
answer yet how to how to do that


**Bill Cassidy:**
 yes I
don't have a solution

**Carlo Vicari:**
 well as far as the
the proposals and the incentive to vote
did you have any you know thoughts
while you were there or suggestions on
you know maybe different incentive
policies to get the masternodes more
involved or maybe more of the regular
nodes to balance out the masternodes
potentially because you said it wasn't
just the big whales that weren't voting
you said it was across the board that
you were getting low voter turnout
correct


**Bill Cassidy:**
 yes so I think there's
possibly two solutions that I've thought
of and I don't know if they could work
or the can't work but it's
either you can penalize you can penalize
the master node owners for not loading
or you can reward the master node owners
for voting right so let's say you're a
master node owner and you skip on three
proposals let's say you don't vote on
three different the three latest
proposals well then let's say if that
happens and you'll miss one of your
master node rewards or you'll be
drop off the list or you'll be moved to
the end of the reward line right but
people don't really agree that we master
node owner should be penalized for not
participating so the flip side is
like let's say you are a master node and
you are participating then maybe there
can be some kind of extra incentive for
those who are participating

**Carlo Vicari:**
 well one
thing I was thinking about was maybe a
flat bounty for a proposal you voted for
actually winning and you would
maybe everyone that voted could chop the
reward I don't know it's an idea
peaceable are possible cuz actually it
would go ahead


**Bill Cassidy:**
 right now when you
submit a proposal it's the cost five
Dash right so that five dash is just
it's burned it goes into some Dark
wallet or whatever I don't know where it
goes it's burned or something so you
could use that as the as the what you
were just saying 


**Carlo Vicari:**
yes I think you would
the thing is if you say had you know a
thousand people you know potentially
looking at the future if you had a
thousand people voting on something a
five-cent reward you know a soda-can
might not really bring anybody

**Bill Cassidy:**
 exactly


**Carlo Vicari:**
so you know there could be some sort of
treasury system set up where there are
funds pre you know allocated or set
aside for specific proposals or when
they're submitted and the bounty is put
there to as a
collection or something like that and
then if it doesn't go through then it's
returned back to the Treasury or you
know something like that it is crossed
my mind because it would even work you
know my first thought was well then
what if everyone just voted for the top
book the top one just to get the reward
and when but then really you've got say
how would it work with the proposals
usually two or three that win correct 



**Bill Cassidy:**
so
there's like a specific amount
of allocated Dash per month rule it all
really depends on how much the proposal
is asking for it I see so if there's
7,000 Dash per month and there's a huge
like there's the core team is receiving
2100 Vermont for the core budget so
there's if it's 7,000 that's 5,000 left
remaining you know and then I said the
dash core team they say they want
to take eighty percent or something each
month eighty percent they say that
they're going to go for and they'll
leave the other twenty percent to to the
community I see so it would be it would
be hard to determine which one is better
or like I say gonna pay more if there's
an incentive I guess I don't know


**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes I
was thinking probably be a flat and then
even if there was one say a second
proposal that nobody was really voting
on it would drive incentive to vote
either negative or for it because
you'd be chopping it with less people if
everybody piled into the one to the one
proposal now there's there's multiple
votes I guess right in multiple
downloads is that correct 

**Bill Cassidy:**
for isn't astern over 
his master note 

**Carlo Vicari:**
if they get
to vote on one thing is that right


**Bill Cassidy:**
 no
you can vote on every proposal once


**Carlo Vicari:**
every proposal once 

**Bill Cassidy:**
and well you can
change your vote to like you if you vote
yes you can change it to know it doesn't
stand you know 

**Carlo Vicari:**
I say 

**Bill Cassidy:**
so but you can only
vote on a proposal with one vote is what
I'm saying 

**Carlo Vicari:**
okay got you can

**Christian Seberino:**
 I make a
profit so I just I like to
when I see something
positive i like to call it out so we we
all agree there's no perfect method to
for the decentralized communities to
work out these issues no perfect
voting system but i have to hand it to
the dash community having having any
voting system is is a lot better than
having no voting system there was a when
the the dow attack was happening and
people are trying to decide what to do
you may have heard there was a system
called the carbon vote that was hastily
thrown together and there was no
infrastructure in place to do a proper
vote and so just you know what I'm
saying having having anything in place
at least gives you something that you
could use to communicate in in some
structured manner so that's I commend
them for for having that and then trying
to attack that problem 

**Bill Cassidy:**
right and it
works to actually like I've used this
whole I've submitted my own proposal
I'll tell you guys about that in a
second and I've voted on proposals in it
works you know I've SAT and watched
people get paid for doing work that
they've proposed that they would do you
know it's all don't agree with you



**Christian Seberino:**
 yes
and I imagine if there was a crisis that
are some decision that had to be made
really fast everybody would would hit
they would use the existing right this
the voting mechanisms you have in place
and you a special vote or something but
it would be a lot easier than trying to
throw a new system together to be


**Bill Cassidy:**
 right

**Carlo Vicari:**
and the LA what was the proposal you
you were talking you're just about to
tell us about

**Bill Cassidy:**
 so just this is a lot
trying to say that the whole Dash budget
system is bad or anything or I'm not
trying to highlight these negative
aspects of it


**Carlo Vicari:**
 no

**Bill Cassidy:**
 it's not it's not
perfect you know 

**Carlo Vicari:**
no it's cool we're here
to talk about you know the pros are
pros but really talking about the
negatives and trying to figure out what
we can do moving forward and how we can
build on it is kind of what this
interview and the show is really the
most important aspect of it so I'm all
about it let's go 

**Bill Cassidy:**
right so there's
two three proposals that were very
questionable in my eyes over the last
since the budget system was released and
the first one I'll just review these
real fast the first one was the Dash
website dot org website and basically
they asked for two thousand Dash at the
time and I think it came out to like
five thousand dollars total for the
price of Dash at the time and uh they
were going to use that money to develop
a new website right for that guy and
this was in October of 2015 that this
proposal was passed I believe October
2015 is when this proposal
passed i c'n the website is still not
done to this day literally they have not
developed the new website to this day
and we don't know if they converted that
dash in to fiat cash or if they held on
to that Dash right so if they converted
it into Fiat then they would have five
thousand dollars in their pocket still
because they haven't used any of the
money I mean right the website if
they didn't convert it into Fiat then at
the price of Dash right now they've got
around twenty thousand dollars for a
website that they were supposed to build
and hope that they haven't built and so
where's that money you know that was one
of my questions was worse that money


**Christian Seberino:**
 who
was it that / pote proposed to build the
website were these unknowns or were they
just I'm personalities or

**Bill Cassidy:**
 so these are
these are some core core team members
daniel diaz is one of the core team
members he's the he's business relations
and Dash and he was doing quite a few
proposals before Ryan Taylor came along
and i believe the website proposal was
done by Evan and Evan was doing a bunch
of proposals because if evidence
submitted a proposal is basically an
instant yes boat from all the
masternodes you know Zoe and at the time
when he submitted the website proposal i
was all 4 i was like yes let's do
let's build a new website 5,000 here you
go take it but the issue i'm
highlighting here it's that we
come back to that how do you force
people to do work that they promised
that they were going to do and then what
are the what are the repercussions you
know what are the what can you do about
it if they don't do that work not much
you can do about it really except for
cry and complain on the forums and chat
rooms right 


**Carlo Vicari:**
could there be something
like could there be something like they
the person who promised to do the work
then the Dash or the be crypto is then
moved to an escrow account that moves
after certain milestones or something
like that rather than they just get all
the funds at once 

**Bill Cassidy:**
I'm sure that they
could set something up like that but at
that time it was all way to New TSI
thinking about that I catching another
questionable proposal is the lamb assu
ATM so that they highlighted they they
submitted this proposal and in like the
title and everything they're like
Lambeth sue ATM like integration and all
this stuff but if you read the fine
print of this proposal it ended up that
lamb a choux had nothing to do with
this proposal whatsoever they weren't
involved nothing it was some third-party
crappy ATM reseller lamisah ATM reseller
based out of Panama and ID's yeah this
was like this was this proposal was
pushed adamantly by the core team too
and they were all about it and I wrote a
crazy long PDF about this thing and like
tried to expose like I'm not calling it
a scam but it was pretty scammy in my
opinion you know like and the thing is
is that even after I wrote this PDF and
exposed this somewhat questionable
lamisah proposal no hardly any of the
masternodes even even cared they just
didn't care 


**Christian Seberino:**
yes so there's one more
is there way oh does that mean that the
masternodes we should start being
suspicious of their virtue
then if or they're



**Bill Cassidy:**
 just lazy I know
possibly maybe they got paid
for me I don't maybe they're part of it
I don't know you know I can only
speculate at this point but the fact of
the matter is that they basically
mislead the masternode owners with these
titles and you know they they even put
the lamba see like logo at the
very top of this proposal like on the
forums so anyone that didn't read this
proposal and just looked at the
headlines Oh lamo so yes let's we're
going to integrate with lamb a suit
awesome let's do it and literally that's
what everyone thought to they thought
Dash was integrating with lab see if you
google Dash lamis ooh there's like
article there's articles written about
it like Dash integrating with lamb a
suits like well they weren't though



**Carlo Vicari:**
what else do we have to watch out
for what else do you think we can
improve upon or should we improve on you
think



**Bill Cassidy:**
 so just straight-up scammers like
you have the system where people can
submit purple andum anonymous people can
submit proposals and there was this
proposal called dart payments right dart
and daniel diaz Dash business relations
guy yes he uh back this proposal he
didn't submit it but he backed these
guys and he vouched for these vouched
for these guys submitting this proposal
and so if you read these guys
proposal let me just give you the quick
intro they said to drive adoption of
Dash one of the important pieces of
infrastructure required is a high
quality Dash exclusive payment gateway
with instant fiat conversion bit paying
coinbase have been instrumental in
encouraging merchants to add Bitcoin as
payment options on their sites
introducing dart payments and then they
go into their whole proposal about what
they want how much Dash they want yada
and this this whole thing ends
up being a scam you know these guys were
vet these guys were vouched for by the
Dash poorer community and it ends
up being a scam these these guys
disappear they don't do anything their
websites like gone
anybody that option to like purchase
these dark stickers and the
stickers like never got sent out people
like sent them Dash never got stickers
and so not what I did what I did after
this proposal it passed they got
funding for one month literally it
passed and it ended up being a scam so I
wanted to show the dash community house
not stupid but like you guys need to
just think out more before you just
click a button that says yes right 
I submit it I submitted my own proposal
and it was based off the dart payment
proposal and i called it unicorn rainbow
ass and let me let me give you my intro
real fast right so it says to make Dash
people feel great one of the important
pieces of apple pie is a high-quality
data retention payments through gateways
with instant rotten cherries bin pay and
coinbase have been instrumental in
encouraging the insect colonies to add
Bitcoin as an appetizer at Denny's but
we think it would be better if they add
dash because it tastes much better right
so it was basically a parody of this
dart payments proposal and I submitted
it and my reasoning behind this was like
idiots you just passed this scamp me
proposal like here


**Carlo Vicari:**
you
were calling attention to something
through a satire you know

**Bill Cassidy:**
 yes
exactly and everyone loved it you can
google that if you google a unicorn
rainbow ass dashed off you can read hate
read the whole proposal and I stay
silent about it for for a few weeks and


**Christian Seberino:**
I'm wondering um that a solution might
be something along the lines of a
reputation system like eBay has

**Carlo Vicari:**
 that's
true


**Bill Cassidy:**
 waiting for the master node owners
are four people submitting proposals

**Christian Seberino:**
 her
to deal with with scammer

**Carlo Vicari:**
 maybe both

**Bill Cassidy:**
yes I guess you have to have
a certain amount of points before you
can submit a proposal or something



**Carlo Vicari:**
 maybe
that's an interesting
idea um also I was thinking you know I
kind of that I but you know the ETC
community kind of goes through this as
well uh and it's just people that send
that things on or post things and
promote things I always ask you know
like who are you where did you you know
where'd you go to school where'd you go
to college what's your twitter account
where's your linkedin and people you
know tend to point out that oh that
doesn't matter because i could just make
that oh yeah you can but it's an extra
piece of information that helps me
figure out you know who you are and
where you came from and i can even use
your linkedin to track down your sources
and asks different colleagues and this
and that and it's just uneven


**Bill Cassidy:**
 even if it
is a fake identity you're still putting
the work in too

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes


**Bill Cassidy:**
 I using a fake
identity


**Carlo Vicari:**
 so as long as I can you know
obviously a blockchain or community gets
to a point where there's so many
projects going on that it's impossible
to to keep track of them all but as long
as we are still you know kind of
building and building our foundation if
I can do everything that I can to look
into these projects and look into every
single person that's on the website from
you know what they say they did to their
contacts and their contacts context i
trace everything that I can to try to
find any holes so that's always in


**Bill Cassidy:**
these guys yes they even said
in their proposer like oh we won't want
to stay anonymous we don't want anyone
to know who we are were two brothers
from now I alien or something


**Carlo Vicari:**
 for me for
stuff like this anonymous is a pretty
big red flag obviously it's different
i was saying yeah obviously if it's
different if it's like a very sensitive
you know they're proposing you know Silk
Road something whatever but if it's a
very innocuous project that the the
anonymous part just is a real red flag
to me and the less open a team seems to
be about reaching out to the community
or about building uh you know a
reputation within the community if you
know if they come out
just say we're launching and they
really don't have any relationship it's
tough you know crypto has been somewhat
jaded to all this stuff and they're
pretty skeptical so I'm glad everybody
for the most part does their due
diligence but forgot I still happen you
know how it is 


**Bill Cassidy:**
I mean that red flag in
this dart proposal like anybody should
have saw that like and but we they still
passed it you know like my response to
them saying we want to be anonymous is
like hey you guys want to come on my
podcast and actually tell everybody who
you are they're like nope no sorry
we're not going to do that you


**Christian Seberino:**
 know let
me just can I make a comment so now you
don't have to give up privacy to have
reputation so it's a true so you could
have both you could have right you could
sign all your documents with a private
key and that that you can only send good
stuff and then people would know that if
something is signed with that private
key it's it's probably credible and so
that is possible but it would take a lot
of work you'd have to do a lot of stuff
to develop that reputation and keep your
privacy but it is possible

**Carlo Vicari:**
yes
possible but as far as projects
that are saying hey we want to do this
for you guys give us the money I want to
know like who you are man 

**Bill Cassidy:**
yes exactly
look you get you got one post under your
user name right here man like


**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes you
can still disappear with the money but I
at least want to be able to harass your
email address or something I don't know


**Christian Seberino:**
hold on what let me give you an example
like suppose suppose somebody said hi
I'm Satoshi and I can prove it and I
want you to give me money to make an
even better crypto currency system right
obviously he has enough of a reputation
you would trust him without needing to
know his real identity right


**Carlo Vicari:**
 right

**Christian Seberino:**
though that was my point


**Carlo Vicari:**
 well  I
guess I know what you mean you mean in
reference to a pgp key and then if 
but how would you know it's the real
Satoshi I mean I I don't know I know
what you're saying though and it
definitely something i would love to
implement but you know there's
there's all sorts of stuff like that so
I you know I i think you know we've
talked about a lot bill and loved having
you on there any questions you have for
us maybe or anything you want to discuss
her 



**Bill Cassidy:**
I don't know 


**Carlo Vicari:**
 Christian have
any other questions for for bill or
anything like that 


**Christian Seberino:**
no I'm just a
thankful that he opened my eyes to
existing governance model that was try
he's giving me a lot to think about and
I hope lots of other people will listen
to this conversation be thinking about
this hard problem because it's gonna be
one that's gonna be ongoing that we need
to solve



**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes definitely I think this
should start you know wish or Sparkle a
lot of great discussion amongst the
community and maybe not even just the
ETC community or dashed me you know
blockchain community in general because
this is an important aspect of a lot of
these blockades going forward I think so
um bill great to have you on and I'm
sure this won't be the last time we'll
have you on the show and yes thank you
forward to speaking with you the future
working on stuff you know


**Bill Cassidy:**
 yes for sure
it's been great guys I really appreciate
you having me on

**Carlo Vicari:**
 yes absolutely let
us know if you ever need anything all
right you know whatever it is we got you

**Bill Cassidy:**
yes we'll be in touch for sure thank
you

**Carlo Vicari:**
 absolutely take care but
you
