# Let's Talk ETC Stewart Mackenzie (Sjm) - Emerald, SputnikVM, ETCDEV & More.
**Carlo Vicari:**
hi everybody you're listening to let's
talk et Cie I'm your host karlovy along
with my co-host dr. Christian suberino
on today's show we've got a really
special guest with a sight Stuart
Mackenzie goes by SJM on slack he's been
working on a ton of stuff for the e.t.c
community he's part of e TC dev team so
we're really happy to have him on to get
some info on a lot of the stuff that
they're doing for e TC in the UTC
community and just really pushing the
project forward into new paths and new
things that the community wants to
accomplish and we're just really happy
to have them on so Stuart thanks for
coming on the show or SJM as many more
people will know you I know how it is in
the online community
everybody's got handles and stuff like
that so thanks thanks for joining us so



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
thank you it's great to be here


**Carlo Vicari:**
absolutely 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
to two o'clock in the morning
in Hong Kong time 



**Carlo Vicari:**
okay so for anyone
listening out there I actually didn't
know it was so late for SJM so double
thank you for being on the show so late
I really appreciate it and I think the
community is gonna be really excited to
hear some of the stuff you've got to let
them know about that's going on 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
oh it's
not high pitch it's not -




**Carlo Vicari:**
 no no so
that's Jan so something we like to do on
the show
also letting people know about some of
the stuff you're working on but just so
the community gets a feel for the people
that are working on the project and some
of the stuff that's going on behind the
scenes and just to kind of connect
everybody with some of the key people
that are working on cool stuff for e.t.c
just give a little bit everybody that's
listening a bit about your background
kind of how you got into tech
development and stuff like that you know
maybe a little bit of history so people
get to know some people behind the
scenes oh 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
well okay um after high school
I remember backpacking around Europe and
I'm thinking gosh what was it I really
wanted to do I went back to South Africa
and and picked up computer science
University of Johannesburg and since
then started you know just working in
different companies and traveling the
world I get as well
and I'm out to Hong Kong um I actually
really liked Hong Kong um you know the
government sort of works yeah although
some might disagree well now that it's
becoming more and more Beijing oriented
but um but you know it's it's it was a
lot better than then then the corrupt
government of South Africa from which I
was born and raised
um and yeah I just sort of working out
here and doing my own thing involved in
open source projects one past couple
years of you working on my own
programming language well I like it
it's more like a DSL 




**Christian Seberino:**
okay so you're
developing your own that's kind of cool



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
well yeah yeah it's well it was it's
quite good fun um it's it's basically
it's a it's a it's a flow-based
programming language it's called fractal
ID and um yeah so the idea behind this
was to create a programming language
where each of the components is reusable
as well as reproducible and and I was uh
I was collaborating with Professor Peter
fan boy out in the universite
catholique de lugar and he sort of like
you know he offered me to suit yell
offered whether I would have supervised
one of his master's students and I
accepted that I had a key to creative
control over this this project and we
set about implementing fractal I'd now
if some of you remember this is going
back quite a few years
you guys remember HyperCard




**Christian Seberino:**
 yes that was
on Apple right

 
**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yes 



**Carlo Vicari:**
that's a that's a
Christian question so very good



**Christian Seberino:**
 I don't
know 



**Carlo Vicari:**
as you guys know but at least you
heard of it so that's good 






**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah okay so
some - card was a quite an interesting
program in of its day it allowed you to
do something like it was it was like you
know non-programmers could could come
and start creating
programs and and start sharing them with
people and it was like the first sort of
like rapid development rapid application
development our ad type environment and
I remember looking at this thinking that
he held this would be this would have
been a really good like internet browser
so so one other one this is the main
sort of idea I want you to implement I
want you to swap out this hyper talk now
hyper talk was like an English language
that you would use to program this this
environment and I want you to swap it
out with these components these reusable
reproducible components which would
actually be the the programming language
of this hyper card implementation so we
sort of set about doing that but we we
got the underlying language working the
reproducible reusable stuff that's that
sort of working but we haven't got the
hyper card layer implemented yet so we
do obviously use that language to
implement the hyper card so um yeah
actually and I've sort of been toying
with that with the idea of actually
creating an IC o---- on top of aetherium
classic - 




**Christian Seberino:**
yeah I call it good




**Carlo Vicari:**
 crowd fun
your crowd fund out oh 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah oh yeah yeah
yeah that like what the ICO is like a
bad word doesn't really like the wristy



**Carlo Vicari:**
I actually I think it started out as a
serious suggestion but then it became so
funny that now it's more of a joke than
anything but it's a serious joke




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
Oh is he Oh




**Christian Seberino:**
 Stuart can I ask you I I'm
going I'm intrigued back of something he
said okay Hong Kong okay so I'm gonna
reveal my ignorance but my I've heard
Hong Kong is like the most one of the
one of the freest countries so you might
even say the most libertarian they they
pretty much leave you alone
no so so would you so but you like it so
it's so would you agree with that or do
they
works pretty well with the government
off your back 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah okay so this isn't
this is becoming more of a local issue
but but I think things are starting to
change now for example you get these
book book publishing places they're just
book shops and what they would do they
they publish sort of literature which
which sort of documents what's going on
in in mainland China or Beijing the
Communist Party and whatnot so recently
I don't actually about a year ago so the
actual the bookshop owner was was
kidnapped and taken across the border
yeah I was taken across the border so
you know when journalists start
experiencing this kind of behavior it's
it's like the early warning signs other
this time to come in so yeah I think
that's enough yeah
I think things are starting to change it
out there like of course yes
all right this is a very strong culture
of this libertarian sort of like yeah
there's a fair kind of environment but
anyway yeah Hong Kong good stuff I like
it out yes it's 



**Carlo Vicari:**
now is is in your
experiences with Hong Kong and South
Africa or where were you living when you
got into the crypto rabbit hole so to
speak
cuz you're into development you're
developing your own languages but where
was the Segway I guess into to
blockchain tech oh 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
right ok well ok so
so I you know right in the early days a
Bitcoin oh this is where it kind of gets
a little bit trimmed like pain because
I've lost my figure I've lost a lot of
money I don't quite fit the passwords



**Carlo Vicari:**
yeah I think 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
oh yeah but it's it's
insane how much it's it's millions of
dollars but anyway it's it's ok it's I
can I can I can see the the account I
can see the money but it's like
untouchable but it's fine it's fine it
doesn't matter



**Christian Seberino:**
um are you saying you lost your private
keys that what happened oh 




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
no no the
password customer so back in the back of
those days we could with a fun thing it
was a fun thing 





**Carlo Vicari:**
for no other reason for
no other reason not for some finder's
fee or something can can we make it a
personal little side project to help
connect you with someone to crack that



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
okay so I've already I've already done
this I've already done this man



**Carlo Vicari:**
 I've
sure you have but keep going don't go
mad I believe I'm here




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
I had a WS AGP user running like you
know brute-forcing the crap out of the
thing I've even gone 


**Carlo Vicari:**
I really like path
huh uh 


**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah yeah I've even gone to a
hypno hypnotherapist oh my god no this
is how desperate 




**Christian Seberino:**
it is literally have
millions of dollars if you could get
this password 




**Carlo Vicari:**
you know okay I think I
think everybody has a bit of a story um
like this because we've been in Bitcoin
and stuff for a little period of time
the only way I can rationalize it and
sleep at night is that I would have sold
I would have never held to this you know
what I'm saying like the only way any of
us can ever actually cover so really
what you might have done and I'm gonna
spin this very positively for you even
though the total crap 


**Stewart Mackenzie:**
you know you don't
need it but



**Carlo Vicari:**
 it's di for you I'm old
enough to take it but - yeah but 



**Carlo Vicari:**
no no
this is this might be true this might
end up being true what you might have
done is invent for yourself the perfect
holding device for holding on to your
VidCon and one day you're gonna crack it
and you're gonna be a happy man I
believe 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah so this this is actually
this isn't one of the one of the things
I'm sort of interested I'm really
interested in building a quantum
computer partially because it's really
you know interesting from a technical
perspective but once it's actually three
[Laughter]
but one so once I've actually got it
working I become I feel that you know
could you please
don't algorithm bang there we go it's
thank you mama




**Carlo Vicari:**
did you ever if you're ever if you're
ever doing like a serious presentation
it like say like Oxford I don't know
just some like prestigious school just
have like on slide one all the benefits
of what you're trying to do and at the
bottom and asterisks that just says like
and to crack my Bitcoin password



**Christian Seberino:**
 well
actually whoa timeout you know what if I
had that quantum computer you know what
I would do I would ignore your account
and I'd go after Satoshi nakamoto's
account he has billions of dollars worth
recording 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
oh yeah yep that's yeah that
could be it could be I I've none of none
of this has a failed my attention but
open but the thing is that the thing is
like just just getting to the point of
building a quantum computer is an utter
nightmare like we've been we've been
cracking at this for almost two years
now and and and it involves a number of
processes the first one is to is to pull
a vacuum so you know yeah okay a vacuum
what was the point of a vacuum so you
get these you have like low vacuum you
can get these vacuum pumps which sort of
suck out the air you have to reach high
vacuum or and ultra-high vacuum that's
like you know 10 to the minus 11 milli
tall which is like deep outer space kind
of thing and once once you've gotten to
that point then you have to like you
have to have the electronics to be able
to control what's going on inside this
ion trap and then you've got to make the
lasers on top of this so so it's it's
it's a multi-year project which is
absolutely insanely difficult um I don't
know I think this right because like
between five and ten years just insane




**Christian Seberino:**
it might be like nuclear fusion it's
always years away






**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 oh no I know I think I
think they've got they've got fusion
working recently I think it's a fusion
reactor in Germany if I recall that's
actually it's online now and 




**Christian Seberino:**
I'm saying
yeah I like words a lot huge benefit and
it's very you know about breakeven and
all that good stuff






**Stewart Mackenzie:**
oh yeah well anyway anyway so we'll see
what comes of this uh of this uh this is
this quantum computer but of course we
have to make an ion trap first an ion
trap is a very simple wealth the in
theory and simple you trap an ion inside
a a vacuum and then you can start
reading and writing information to this
ion but then when you need quantum
computers you need to have multiple
atoms all trapped at once in sort of
like communicating entangled with each
other and that's when things you have
really get difficult and expensive so
there we can move on from this topic
it's probably too technical 



**Christian Seberino:**
so I got it
I have to say this I was reading
recently about emerald wallet I assume
you know there was some press release or
there is something I've netted I saw and
then and that and that was my first
exposure and it said that it was
trustless a trustless wallet Oh smells
like holy moly woke okay that's amazing
can you I don't I don't know if this is
the first crustless wallet or can you
elaborate on that but that really 




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
okay
all right okay okay so yeah emerald
emerald is not just a wallet emerald a
set of tools which sort of like each
sort of specializes on on one thing and
and in this particular in this
particular if this instance of this
trustless aspect is you can have you can
have your private keys on another
machine which is which has the
appropriate security areas and you can
actually get that communicating with
with Jeff or with another aetherium
client and that can that can have open
ports you know you can have you can have
in incoming ports and outgoing ports
which are open to the Internet and a lot
of a lot of places
are hesitant la sorry not a lot of
organizations maybe exchanges and
whatnot are bit hesitant of doing that
so you can't get this um peer-to-peer
connections that are happening so so but
by putting your private keys on another
machine it's basically kind of like a
hardware wallet it's kind of like a
treasure device right you just press a
button 



**Christian Seberino:**
and you have very controlled
limited communication with yeah yes




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
so this this allows exchanges and and
well even even somebody who's running a
ecommerce website to to have their
private keys in a certain a certain
server which would be which would be
have the appropriate levels of security
and and you you know you can have your
web servers and all those other sort of
servers in in your in your in your in
your infrastructure able to communicate
with this thing so that's that's that's
one sort of aspect of it another another
another thing is that um we can also
have like a command-line interface so as
as as Kostya who's a one of the other
DTC dev team members you refers to this
is the Dark Side of the Moon
so this is this is the area where where
end users typically won't really go this
is more for programmers this is more for
developers you know there's a nice
there'll be a nice command-line
interface so you can actually write
scripts which would automate a lot of
things so you could write here and make
transactions query the blockchain it's
that sort of thing and of course and of
course this is also where sputnik comes
into it so you could you could also like
write contracts and and compile them to
the by code and run them in through
sputnik vm and get an idea of costs and
whatnot so so it from one perspective
it's just like different tools which can
be combined together and we want to come
we want to make it such that a developer
can can include these like for example
with with foreign front
interface or with JSON endpoint RPC
endpoint or just like CLI that's that
sort of thing more ways to mix and match
this software makes it more easier to
build stuff on top of



**Christian Seberino:**
 sure sure
now when you said emerald was um when I
read trustless for some reason I was
thinking of that you had somehow
implemented it in a smart contract and
it was decentralized like different
people talk about decentralized
exchanges right that's what I kind of
thought you had you meant but okay so
and I the way be 






**Stewart Mackenzie:**
maybe I'll I didn't
actually write that article so so I'm
not even very sure which which article
you're referring to but okay that that
would be my interpretation of mmm trust
so far on her Forenza then maybe that's
a better position was it further 







**Carlo Vicari:**
sorry
for the non technicals I guess you could
say to me this sounds like um or I would
describe it sounds like like a workbench
with lots of different tools to build
some interesting things for et Cie is
that 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
uh yeah yeah you know that that's
okay so for example okay like let's say
you want you wanted to create a new
aetherium client maybe in a movie for
example I wouldn't need to re-implement
the etherion virtual machine you
wouldn't need to implement the store but
the basically the database right which
was the blockchain you wouldn't need to
implement for example the you know the
trusted part that looks after the the
private keys and whatnot
you could just include because it would
be a standard like you know track as if
you're talking to a seal I I'm getting
too technical as if you're talking to a
tea library that's basically like a
library that you could pull into your
applicant ooh your Ruby application or
your Python application and just say
okay this this this particular component
does one thing it does one thing as well
okay I'll just bring it in and use it
and I can add you know the sort of like
the fluff around the side and make it
you know add XYZ feature
so it yeah yeah 





**Christian Seberino:**
so now facing like a
luggable up of components that you could
mix and match 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah exactly and and it's
pretty good it's a pretty good thing
because you know like um the community
can like maintenance can and and a
development can be focused on in one
area 





**Christian Seberino:**
now now when you're exacting about
you when you were talking about the
language you are creating using we're
using words like you know components
swap this somehow in your brain here




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
your son
you sir are an astute chat yes yes this
is one aspiration I've got I want to use
the Emerald tools and bring them into my
programming language in other words uh
should should my hypothetical crowd sale
go off well I would I would I'd love to
be able to build a new team to actually
bring in this md's emerald components
and create maybe a third if you rien
classic client but this is a these are
big words at the moment I'd I have no
idea whether the community would be
supporting of this 






**Christian Seberino:**
or not this might be
a dumb question but the that's just good
what yours what you're proposing is good
software engineering where you break
things up into components and capitation
so isn't why or maybe they already do
but parity gift don't those already kind
of put things in sandboxes or





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 okay uh
despots they're just different styles of
breaking things apart but I mean yeah I
see I see parity is rather a monolith as
well as gif okay it's just okay yes it's
a massive monolith 





**Christian Seberino:**
uh yeah maybe maybe
when they were designed they didn't have
the intention that people would go in
and 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
possibly


**Christian Seberino:**
 ponens yeah okay 


**Stewart Mackenzie:**
so quite
possibly but then at the same time like
you know there's some good engineering
that's going on in parenting you know I
can't I can't I can't fuck them I'm
quite a few things





**Christian Seberino:**
 yeah oh and by the
way I agree with what you said about the
the use of the term wallet I was talking
with the lane about this and I guess
Bitcoin is what started that that term
but I I've been thinking maybe client is
better or you were proposing framework



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
so oh this is just different words I
suppose um yeah I think I think it lands
right the concept of a wallet and it
does sort of you know it does it does
sort of work well you know like with
your with your Bitcoin with your theory
that's in my wallet
yeah yeah why not yeah yeah 





**Christian Seberino:**
so and then
also about the sputnik vm so it's a
hybrid it's a library that everybody
could I was reading yeah people can talk
to it with over a socket or various
methods and so it's very flexible yeah
now



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 these these are some of the
aspirations and you know the more the
more you allow people more different
ways you allow people to connect and use
your software the more likely it's going
to be used and the morons use the more
bugs will be found the more you know the
more useful it is yeah but yeah yeah but
but but I mean there's still a long way
to go like for example it isn't
something else is really important
that's happening in in the etherium
classic community and that's the Risso
work that Hoskinson is is is
spearheading that's the the formal
verification of the EDM that stuff is
really it's going to be really important
for us so I'm keeping a really close eye
on network is really great that that
that Hoskinson came through this really
excellent 






**Christian Seberino:**
yeah oh yeah related I had a
question this is for both of you this is
a people question that is not technical
but I like what you said about the more
people that use code the more bugs the
more help you'll get though I'm halls
looking at it on the other hand some of
people in the audience list
- this might be thinking way hold on if
Stuart makes this library and if so I
like for example you may have heard that
hyper ledger IBM's involve magic they
recorded the EVM and so everybody could
port the EVM to their own little
favorite blockchain and on one hand I
it's a good thing but then do you think
like that might provide competition for
et Cie 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
it's open source I mean like ok
you know just I just 



**Carlo Vicari:**
and I think it's a
good thing my 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
aunt get it yeah well I I
don't know like like use it go for it
use it I mean I designed to be used um
if you if you introduce it into your
blockchain and you find a bug in it and
you submit it but that's great then then
yeah you've solved a potential bug that
could have happened on the etherium
classic blockchain thank you very much
yeah now more robust and more resilient
as a result of this
so am please go ahead




**Christian Seberino:**
yeah we're not really at this stage the
block chains aren't at the stage like
where you have like Android and iPhone
you know compromise for world domination
we're just trying to have more people
use the technology to begin with 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
well I
think well I think also from from this
perspective I if I'm not if I'm correct
this is like no they are sip there are
other implementations of the EVM like
standalone sort of things but but you
know like something some example you see
you in classic is is is you know top 5
but the other aetherium have got have
already got implementations of of the
EVM but they're buried deep inside the
client yeah it's not really easy to
access them so this will be the well
maybe the first EVM that is designed to
be substandard learn and can be included
as a library through foreign function
interface or FFI which basically that
means almost any programming language
can import this and use
we have not got FFI implemented yet but
it's coming hopefully





**Christian Seberino:**
 so yeah I don't
know I don't wanna you know make force
you to give promises of the future
Yankee you want to say without without
putting you on the spot but can you say
anything about dates and the status
right now of emerald in 




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
okay um so I
have discussed with her with e.t.c dev
and I was told not to say Monday okay
I was so lot to say on Monday but
sometime during the next week
we've got a few more points that need to
be knocked off um and I'm also mentor
and I also want to highlight that this
is the first release its beta it's it's
it's you know just it's still a lot of
work that needs to go into this and a
lot of massaging and you know polishing
and evolving I mean we're going to be
working on this for quite a while yet so
this is an initial release we can get
feedback from the community I hope the
community can be polite about it and
constructive and we can evolve it from
there 





**Carlo Vicari:**
they might be constructive I don't
know about the lighting it's 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
never mind
didn't everyone it's alright




**Christian Seberino:**
 so fire
fire B where's what you're saying don't
put your life's a little zero emerald
account just yet uh 






**Stewart Mackenzie:**
hmm let's see let's
see
as far as for Sputnik um well we've just
we've ways just implemented the home
front as well as a frontier sort of
patches and the once once that's sort of
up and running we want to get the more
you know become more efficient and then
we would just sort of include it into
gear so so so that means so that means
basically we've got one sort of like
standalone thing which can be applied to
multiple different if your implants and
this makes maintenance a lot easier
across the different clients so yes
for example um uh it's what we could you
know guess would would would keep going
maybe I you know hopefully I would
create another if um classic client and
maintenance makes it a lot easier cross
the two clients about 




**Christian Seberino:**
yeah so wait hold
on wait so the thinking behind I think
the theory foundation was to have
multiple implementations to iron out
bugs but now just to play devil's
advocate right if if all of a sudden we
made everybody use the same code base we
wouldn't have that you're like you 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
know
I hate I hear you I hear what you're
saying but but you know I I tend to
prefer a nice strict type safe language
you know rust Russ is already pretty
good at this sort of stuff you know and
it wraps your knuckles when you when you
like when you when you don't do
something right and I also like I like
the direction of this formal
verification of Eva get a combination of
these two approaches is going to knock
out a lot of bugs so 




**Carlo Vicari:**
yeah I think it's
important it's important when you have a
lot of money on the line for sure





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 yes
exactly exactly 





**Christian Seberino:**
right now let me ask a
question about formal verification some
people might be wondering so the the dub
quote unquote stupid way to verify is
just to give your code to a thousand
people and if see if anybody complains
which that's basically what the EVM
right we've been using it for a couple
years and it seems to be more half so
now so what what is going to be the the
benefit of having that formal
verification because don't we kind of
effectively have that because it's been
battle-hardened already uh from you know






**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yes and no because because uh alright I
I'm no expert on this topic and no
expert on this topic but formal
verification just basically means that
this piece of software does what it is
intended to do and it is proven to do
that
um and and you know when you've got
millions of dollars on the line you
would you would hope that your software
does what it intended to do right so uh
so that's basically essentially what it
boils down to yeah this doesn't ask you
a question





**Carlo Vicari:**
 yeah well also to point out
that it's more than millions now
whatever yes two billion Francesco
individual really oh okay well that
choice



**Christian Seberino:**
 I don't know if Bitcoin has been
formally verified the core software but
it's it's the confidence is just in the
fact that it's already been battled
tested you know and so much money in
transactions has happened that and
presumably also hackers all over the
world if there was a vulnerability they
would have found it by now so I don't
know 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah come on I mean there's still
they're finding the finding bugs in in
in in open SSL the heart beat heart
bleed staff for for how many you know
that that guy was in there for four
years four years but yeah it came out
recently and cause I




**Christian Seberino:**
 oh there's always
that one-in-a-million chance right what
that's you're you're right that's that
there's a bug that they haven't found in
Bitcoin or the EVM and so yeah I can't
deny that 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
um I don't know III like the
direction of this this formal
verification I think um I think I you
know as I said I'm keeping an eye on
this project and it'd be really grateful
we could like bring in some of the
lessons that this K framework has uh Sok
framework because this is it's it's like
a language which allows you to implement
uh other languages and sort of like you
know um basically formally verifies it
is it's it's quite ragic it's quite
magic but this is a lot of literature
you can read about




**Christian Seberino:**
 this goes back again
this goes right back again to what you
started our the show with your your
dream of making your own language yeah
that's 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
uh yeah actually actually yeah
well yeah I remember um when I first
started looking at I actually picked up
the K framework
and started playing with it and I was
like what the hell is going on here
so maybe I'll get round to at some point
but this this EVM project that's that's
at hoskinson's is guts going is a quite
a good starting point I suppose 





**Christian Seberino:**
oh and
if you could just make a comment so I've
been impressed by etc' dev I it sounds
like Igor is super talented and then
Elaine Elaine says you don't have to be
a genius to this help out et Cie dev I
mean I like how you guys you just
sometimes just go wow man that the level
of talent 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah so it's a recently
beginning getting to know Elaine a lot
better she's really an interesting
person I encourage the community to get
to know her um splits Igor's egos and is
he's a warhorse
this guy's you know he's been around
there he's worked for a number of big
companies out of Russia and different
places so he tries to keep things as
practical as possible and down-to-earth
which I respect and I like and but not
only that he's actually very good with
the team he's very good with the team
and giving people space and allowing
them to sort of do their thing um yeah I
respect that
he's a good leader a good leader 




**Christian Seberino:**
ok
that's yeah not not not every developer
has that 




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah not
every bit that not every developers got
this so this is an interesting aspect
about about Igor and I've worked with a
number of different leaders before and I
can I can say is one of the better ones





**Christian Seberino:**
yeah when I think of great software
managers I think of Linna Stovall's with




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
the Linux kernel hello hello((ULALA)))
yeah he's technically good but um I
would but yeah he gets but he gets a bit
rude on the mailing list 




**Christian Seberino:**
oh yeah after






**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 I
put I press I post either mind 





**Carlo Vicari:**
I want to
hear a mailing list story what what


**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 did
Jesus





**Christian Seberino:**
 say just he he's so advanced that
if you if you ask a stupid question
Linux
just crucifies you on them really but
but sure it's not like that I'm sure
he's more 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
no no no no look I know the
first of all this let's not make you
know let's not make models and what's
what's that saying don't put people on
pedestals and something no I don't let's
not do that but yeah but we learn
estores fault
it's a massive community excuse me the
Linux developer kernel communities is
really really huge they've got these
like lieutenant lieutenants are very
hierarchical to and uh yeah
stupid questions don't they don't fly
little innocent air into you 





**Carlo Vicari:**
so you're
saying I should join the mailing list
and ask




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 yeah just just do a few Google
searches on this I don't think that's
entirely healthy for a community I don't
think that's I don't write him I
personally don't mind and I find his his
rants quite entertaining but you know if
it was a community I was involved or
like you know as a community sort
manager I would I would come down on
that yeah 





**Christian Seberino:**
yeah if like let's say Amer
the Emerald framework takes off and I
yeah I can imagine right you guys having
lieutenant's 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
oh good god I I have WI I
have different mentality about this but
my thoughts are quite different from the
rest of the UTC dev-team and I'm not
going to push my thoughts onto unto them
it's it's it's fine it's a different
approach to things but it's interesting
learning from other people and yeah but
maybe maybe if I maybe if I create my
own clients that I will definitely go
that direction 




**Christian Seberino:**
so you guys the
management it sounds like it's top notch
and funding you guys have funding to
keep doing what you want to do and that




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah yeah but I mean I don't even we
don't even know who's who's behind this
I mean like this there are a few people
um nice people I don't know who they are
but but they've put money early in the
early days I think they've put money
down on the table and basically said you
know build build stuff build useful
stuff make it usable
um anyway I can't really comment on this




**Carlo Vicari:**
well from the there was there were
donations in the beginning which I mean
okay we now have have 20x really so what
were meager donations a year ago are now
relatively substantial potentially




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 I
didn't 





**Christian Seberino:**
say you've got it you have an
account and you have anonymous donators
that give nice gifts that's good to hear




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah oh that yeah yeah yeah so let me
also encourage this to the community
like guys we have elihpa so the
developers are are in some ways um an
important leg of this community 



**Carlo Vicari:**
right
that's an understatement




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
well no I don't want to sort of like you
know over over play and become like
anything 



**Carlo Vicari:**
I'll do it
look.we 




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
no no no let's just meander
which is keep it even you know like ei
thought every member of the community is
really important um but you know let's
not get like this you know you go
overflowing kind of thing but like the
development community is really
important now in in in in in communities
like for example aetherium or other
block chains they they've had pre mines
you see so there's an element of
incentive that goes along with them
being a developer in these in these in
these block chains or these communities
but in if you're in classic it's
slightly different because you know of
the hard fork so the developers that are
involved here don't have that that sort
of like pre mine incentives to keep
people around so so as as in people who
buy coins they sort of come into this
buy they buy coins of other blockchains
but inside that there's a sort of like a
tax that has been imposed on this
through this pre mine but when you buy a
theorem classic you don't have that but
you don't have you also enter this
community without an obligation you know
because you don't have that obligation
in other blockchains but with it here in
classic you're not aware of it but the
community so elevate your support




**Christian Seberino:**
what you mean by obligation is you don't
have a bunch of people in a foundation
that are there their assets are growing
in value as is that you're saying 





**Stewart Mackenzie:**
well a
well yes because the developers here we
don't have that pre mine yeah so when
you less okay so let's say let's say the
developers of the theorem classic have
got a pre mine you buy into this coin
and the pre mine means that there is you
know this so much money which has been
removed from from



**Christian Seberino:**
 from circulation? 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
so I
think you from circulation and which
means that you're basically buying you
know this more expensive coin do you see
what I mean
but now and but now let's say if you're
in classic we don't have this pre mine
so these these coins are you know they
don't come with that so you need to you
need to the community really does need
to support the developers if you don't
do that it's gonna really it's gonna I
don't know well we'll see what happens
maybe maybe we got some sweet talkers
who can organize people pay more your
funding and whatnot




**Carlo Vicari:**
 what are they what
are they used to do for like PBS or
something the telephone




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 oh but yeah
we're we don't even think we okay so so
there are arguments of of saying yeah we
should have a Treasury but you know in
theory Treasuries of great things but
whenever you get a treasurer you get bad
actors and how you deal with those bad
actors is the important thing
mmm-hmm yeah because those bad actors
can they can be tricky bastards they can
be really really tricky bastards they
can play long games they can manipulate
things they can do all sorts of tricky
things and eventually once once they
control the the money flow then at it
you see yeah you're over your


**Christian Seberino:**
 yeah yeah
I see you're right
you're right 




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
so so like like I
personally would be in support of any
sort of like sort of Treasury that comes
forward but it needs to have an
extremely strong emphasis on how to deal
with bad actors and this is a
verification being yeah 


**Carlo Vicari:**
yeah yeah it
currently verified people
I wish thanks buddy here 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah but this
is like an arms race you know we get
like normal human beings and Psychopaths
and we flute the second Andres is what
basically causing evolution of human
beings in some regards so anyway I mean
ya know 






**Christian Seberino:**
I I know you're the et si devs
been very good I saw about you know
she's giving a road map I I saw some
where they had that for the near future
no but you want to do you want to
summarize or kind of make some comments




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
okay so from my perspective I don't
believe in road met at all road maps are
a source of great stress and instead I
would rather encourage the community to
stand up and commute and collaborate and
if you want to see something on that
road map then get up and start doing it
it would be wonderful to have a
community where everybody starts to
contribute in different ways instead of
sitting on their asses saying I'm
getting them getting a bit too emotional
yeah but but instead of sitting on their
asses saying give me give me give me I
you know it'd be much better to see if
you're in classic as a community of like
you know people like get up there and
really go and do stuff yes Ted of just
being hand meowt's rights 




**Christian Seberino:**
well here
here's what I was getting at I was I'm
trying to get a sense is would you say
it were not at the point where the
technology is matured we're running out
of things to do there's still a lot 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
of
God no ways there's so much to do this
so so much to do but let's focus on
fundamentals at the moment let's get you
know it clicks this EVM verification
right let's let's get people a decent
wallet that they can that they can use
let's give people infrastructure that
that they can actually build out
websites and you know infrastructure
around that people feel confident in
that you know that their private keys
not gonna be you know stolen let people
let people build businesses on it when
people build businesses and start
feeding their families then things start
to change
yeah it doesn't become such a
speculative thing anymore




**Christian Seberino:**
 yeah all right
so I think Karl you want to say
something




**Carlo Vicari:**
 no I was going to say
now with the advent of a lot of this
infrastructure that's coming online for
e.t.c and this things start to get built
out more and mature and since especially
e.t.c specifically takes such a
non-interference role in community
affairs with certain things do you
envision and I see an unstoppable ICO
mania occurring on e.t.c at some point
in the future



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 are you question 


**Carlo Vicari:**
you know
what I'm saying because I we definitely
do take a different stance and a more a
much more skeptical stance in reference
to the ICO mania that's going on but as
skeptical as we are about it
we are pretty larger the markets cab
yeah we're a pretty large market cap
coin and I'm not sure there's much we
can do to stem the tide if something
such as that were to start on et Cie so
I was wondering do you see that
potentially happening on etc' as well or
maybe just the general outlook of the
community being different we'll be able
to keep that tied back 




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
okay um the
culture is very much different in Ethier
in classic hmm um and that's one of the
reasons why I like it so much more than
then the the hard folk I
yeah I I don't I don't think I don't
think it's going to reach the same same
scale and I think and I think quite
possibly a number of individuals will
call out scammy coins so and we've got
this a token mint io coming up and I
think this is going to be in a very a
very important player in the in the if
you're in classic community you've got
you've got you've got Elaine
she's hard-nosed she doesn't take
bullshit this one and don't paddock
burns behind this I think maybe there
are other few a few other people um but
you can imagine like as soon as like
some sort of scammy coin gets listed on
this thing I'm very sure I'm very sure
that they will be shut down well at
least I hope so
or or or you know this is sufficient
measures of you know transparency will
be made available forcefully so that the
community can investigate so what's
going on yet like oh do the developers
have a sort of like a nice you know
github account to that sort of thing so
so sorry I think if we sort of like
building this culture of being critical
and not being so easily duped to
handover coins for for stupid projects
then we can just worse with common sense
maybe we can we can do this but yeah
look like I really do think there is an
element of of value that cuz that can
come from these crowd sales 



**Carlo Vicari:**
I do as well
I do it 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah and and yeah actually
actually I'm kind of hoping that this
project that I want to I want to launch
on this on this token mint I should want
to set a good example I want to really
try and set a good example so I'm not
sure how earlier would will be but yeah
I want to have all the ducks in a row
such that you know maybe the community
can look at this and say okay this is
how basically a good project start start
off this is the this is the barrier how
do we improve this 



**Carlo Vicari:**
um yeah I find it
funny that in the crypto community
people blame the ICO or crowdfunding
model and that's kind of analogous to
when people try to say bad things about
cryptocurrency they say oh it's used for
drugs it's used to hide money or evade
taxes or any something like that or you
know any other nefarious activities but
you know you could say the same thing
about cash or any other form of
resources so I think when people see
some of the the scan the crowd funds
that occur they conflate the the system
or how funds are raised with the
projects know that if you have a very
efficient way to raise money obviously
scammers are going to descend upon it
but it doesn't mean that the model in
itself is a bad thing just like the IPOs
from the 90s obviously
whole ton of projects ended up using the
model and diluted it but a lot of great
a lot of great projects came out of um




**Christian Seberino:**
what I would I whenever I teach a
blockchain class the analogy I use is
you could use a brick to build a church
or you could hit somebody over the head
with it throw it through 




**Carlo Vicari:**
yes so much
more eloquently said that by you think



**Christian Seberino:****
the brick is a moral it's not good or
bad 



**Carlo Vicari:**
right 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
yeah I wouldn't say so much
about the church 



**Carlo Vicari:**
okay you can use your
brick to build a charity depends on the
church s evoke you get 


**Stewart Mackenzie:**
no comment 



**Carlo Vicari:**
no
comment 




**Christian Seberino:**
yeah I have you have we
uncovered everything did we miss any
questions Stuart did you did you gotta
say everything you wanted to say last
chance 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
actually a karlova finished it
off with that with that that observation
you made about the the I cos and how the
greed you know how do we stem this this
you know pigs eating at a trough kind of
thing this is degree of greed and uh
yeah I personally wouldn't like to see
that in et Cie Deb is re in a theorem
classic community
I really wouldn't like to see that so I
think yeah it's important that the the
current community members the active
ones sort of keep aware of be aware of
this and thank you come down on come
down on it come down 






**Carlo Vicari:**
I still I still
think that um it's almost like they say
when you throw you know crap on the wall
and see what sticks um that's what's
happening with a lot of this
crowdfunding stuff but I think there is
stuff that's going to stick and prove
it's going to be worth it I think
there's a few there's a few projects out
there that either that already exist or
in the future that are going to be crowd
funded through these token raises and I
think they're going to be the Amazons
and the the googles of the next
generation hopefully 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
so oh yeah I see I
see that too I see that too and that's
that's hopeful
it's one of the reasons why I want to so
to get to my little my little
programming language on to a crowd sale
pretty soon yeah
because I it's the way of the future yes
in my opinion 





**Carlo Vicari:**
maybe well anyway maybe
you could crowd fund the maybe you could
crowd fund the work to be done on the
quantum computer so that you could crack
the word yeah you're on



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 yeah yeah yeah
yeah no no I mean like like okay there
is it okay when I say we're not see
these ridiculous amounts look I've been
speaking to some VCS and you know it's
like you know it's just sort of the
amounts of money that they're offering
on the table is not that much you know
but when you look at when you look at
what's going on with these with these I
SEOs you just think lucky Nora
naughty Nora I I could fund like a
quantum computer with that all they'll
be fantastic but then but then you sort
of need a sort of scalar back in then
sort of set expectations you don't want
to say I don't know maybe make I don't
know maybe maybe the community would
would would want a this a hypercard a
first level and the second level would
be a aetherium classic client and the
third level would be a quantum computer
and I would say ok I'm going to do
crypto analysis on your on your own on a
theorem casick and ensure that we've got
you know post quantum post quantum safe
cryptography for you there we go




**Carlo Vicari:**
and if we don't then I'm gonna crack
everyone's 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
damn straight yes
all your base belong to that yeah 





**Carlo Vicari:**
all
right but uh actually this was a
conversation I just had very recently
how funny it is that the ethereum crowd
sale for 18 million or whatever it was
seemed huge you know last year that that
was like a huge crowd sale you know
eighteen million dollars for was 




**Stewart Mackenzie:**
it but
now what is it now it's funny numbers
for me now I actually have





**Carlo Vicari:**
 okay much so
to put this into perspective a year and
a half ago if you talked about the
etherium crowd sale being 18 million
that was like whoa I can't believe they
were able to do that 


**Stewart Mackenzie:**
that is still 
with
me 




**Carlo Vicari:**
yeah okay
Bank core which was a recent crowd fund
that just occurred raised over
million in three hours and I think worse
they had to turn money away it was
really like 300 million






**Stewart Mackenzie:**
what is this Bank or thing do what does
it do what I was offering you don't know



**Carlo Vicari:**
now now you're going beyond the scope of
my my knowledge 






**Stewart Mackenzie:**
okay III is it vaporware
isin trash did do we know any fact 



**Carlo Vicari:**
I
can't say that it's I can't say that
it's vapor or not paper because I don't
know enough without the project journey
alright but yeah when someone just when
someone described it to me it sounded
interesting but I can't comment without
and without more info but actually know
about them 



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
when I hear this I think when
I hear this I start thinking of tulips
uh-huh




**Carlo Vicari:**
pester calm yes some shit but done
anyway I'm good 




**Christian Seberino:**
so well Thank You Stuart
thank you for hey was great was I'm sure
there's lots of P yeah sure there's lots
of people that want to were you know
interested to hear about emerald is
Sputnik in yeah
EGC Danson



**Stewart Mackenzie:**
 great 





**Carlo Vicari:**
yeah absolutely um
pleasure to have you on thanks so much
for staying out so now it's really late
it was already really late you know it's
even later thanks so much for for
staying up and coming on the show we'd
love to have you on again sometime and
yeah we'd appreciate um you know you're
coming back at any time and we'd love to
have other people from et Cie dev and I
will reach out to them to get them on
here as well talk about all the cool
stuff you guys are doing 


**Stewart Mackenzie:**
cool and thanks
to you guys for keeping the
communication the dialogue if for the
community there's really good thank you


**Carlo Vicari:**
alright guys take care everybody
thanks bye-bye take care
