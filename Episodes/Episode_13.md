# Let's Talk ETC: Daniele Levi Discusses Stampery.
**Christian Seberino:**
hello everybody and welcome to another
episode of let's talk ETÐ¡ today I have
a special guest danielle levy from
Stamper e and he'll be talking about his
technology Carlo is still on travel so I
Chris submarina will be doing the show
and I hope you enjoy it I think it'll be
a great show so let's get right to it so
Danielle why don't you say a little bit
about yourself how you got involved with
Stamper II and how you even got involved
with crypto currencies and block chains





**Daniele Levi:**
hi Chris it's a pleasure to be here with
you thank you very much so how how did I
get involved with cryptocurrencies so I
first learned about Bitcoin at the end
of 2012 I read about it in a blog post
about Silk Road and how these hackers
currency was used in the dark net and
the concept the concept was really
fascinating for me and I have to say
that i bought my very first bitcoins the
very same day or maybe the day after i
first read about about about about
bitcoin and another this is i'm thinking
i need something strange because I've
read about a lot of people saying that
first you need a couple of months to
understand it and then six months till
you till you are able to buy some and
invest some money in them but for me it
was like love at first sight I thought
this is incredible hackers currency
decentralized mining sounded incredibly
clever for me and of course also the
fact that the sadly was limited was
something that really caught my
attention and remember it was quite an
adventure because I try to find
somewhere to buy bitcoin with my credit
cards because
normally everything with bikes with
credit cards on the internet we are not
so used to wire money but of course
buying cryptocurrencies with credit
cards is not the best thing you can do
but they tried very hard and i remember
that i found this lyrics or exchange
which was like an exchange for second
life currency and they also hon okay of
course they charge like huge markup on
the on the spot price but i bought my
first my first bitcoins i think i bought
like three bitcoin for twenty dollars
something like that and they started
buying every day until i
realized that i had to send some money
to mt gox Oh to wire some money
that was the intelligent thing to do but
let's say that the from the very
first moment I dived very deeply into
into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies i
would say that from that day
cryptocurrencies have become my main
focus and i have to say that while i
first learned about cryptocurrency with
bitcoin in 2012 I've always been a fan
of the cyberpunk diggin in fact when I
was a teenager in the mid-90s I
remembered that they spent a lot of time
lurking in in cyberpunk news groups in
the usenet and I remember reading the
things by the wit leaks guy now I
just forgot his name a bias ang sorry
yes and and reading stuff by health
in a four for example and the PGP guys I
remember using PGP I don't remember it
was 1.0 or 2.0 but when it was a
teenager in 1993 or 90 94 and and they
really loved that cipher cyberpunk war
and when I first learnt about Bitcoin
kind of data into that yeah yeah it
really any it really made sense



**Christian Seberino:**
okay all right good and so what is your
what was your background before you
started getting interested in Bitcoin



**Daniele Levi:**
okay so I always been an entrepreneur
and a hacker always be going to take a
hologram well not really I'm not
programming it's not my main skill
but let's say that I can program a
little bit and I've always been
interested in computer science security
hacking and also music and I've been
building companies since I was 22 I
built for five or six companies one of
them I sold it in 2012 so just a few
months before starting before diving
into the crypto currency space and be
specific into the cryptocurrency space
this is the fur the third venture I am
leading in this place first I first
I built a very big mining operation
instead it was 2013 I bought some
avalons I'm avalon avalon machine
machines and then i was i would say the
very first customer of k in c minor and
i bought quite a lot of hard work for
them I think it was lucky to be there
the one that first got their machines
because as you know in mining timing is
crucial so you need to to plug in a new
generation yes early as possible to make
a profit the first
I did let's say I i built and i
managed a big mining operation and it
wasn't 13 then i tried to build an
exchange in switzerland at that time we
had only bitstamp and mt gox really as
good exchanges anything ox was already
giving signs that it was going to fail
i'm speaking about end of 2013 and i
thought that there was a huge
opportunity to create a compliant
exchange a very compliant unprofessional
exchange in Europe being a specific in
Switzerland we were very close we found
an investor but we couldn't find find a
banking partner okay 22 to be able to
operate in in Switzerland so I worked in
that project very hard for like six
seven eight months and when we realized
that we couldn't go ahead because we
didn't find the right partner the right
back in partner we decided to create
something we could build and bootstrap
with our own means without needing to
depend on a third party like like a bank
so that's when we started thinking about
Stan free and that time speaking meet
2014 mid-2014 maybe end of 2014 and Lee
Stanford we wanted to focus
on the use not related directly with the
currency of the blocks and technology
and that's why we created Stamper and at
stamp ring what we do is extremely
simple we just use public blockchains so
both bitcoin an ethereum classic to
generate proof of existence and
integrity and also ownership for
any kind of data sets so files documents
pictures ETC 




**Christian Seberino:**
yes now I was going to I
before the interview I was planning to
ask you how you were so advanced what I
mean is so my impression is people are
slowly getting interested in blockchains
i slowly learn about it and then maybe
slowly they might some people might
think about starting a company but you
know you had the stamp read it's
going strong and I was wondering how did
you get so far ahead and like and you
answered it was because you were just
one of the original people that from the
weight from the very beginning right you
were you were interested in the the
ciphered punk movement and then early
Bitcoin you know about Hal Finney so you
were there from the very beginning
you're one of the authentic real you
know original cryptocurrency fans so
that's pretty impressive and it's
it's interesting that you are always
an entrepreneur and you weren't afraid
to try mining you weren't a that you
even were so ambitious to do an exchange
that's very impressive um and then you
did stanberry and what is
interesting to me one of those lots of
things that are interesting but
basically it is a notary right
notarization that's one way to describe
what you do and you do more but that's
a big part of it and so it would
make sense that you would you would be a
fan of ethereum classic because they're
a big value is immutability right and
they don't want to change the blockchain
that I want to make too many
improvements impulsively and so
I was just really impressed with
your background and it would make sense
that you'd be doing your work on on the
ethereum classic which is that correct
everything 




**Daniele Levi:**
yes it's everything it's
correct I i would like to tell you a
little bit more about why i went only
into crypto currencies i I felt from the
very beginning that this is
the most important revolution from the
from from the internet let's say and
they wanted to be in the front line and
I always had this feeling i saw the
internet revolution because when my dad
brought a model in in my house I was
like 13 and nobody had internet yet
in your lexing Spain in Europe because I
live a live in Spain and I knew that
internet was going to change the world
but I was too immature till two let's
say too young to really focus my career
on that and so I saw that revolution
just let's say happening in front of my
eyes then the second revolution I saw
what I witnessed was the mobile
revolution I saw everybody had mobiles I
knew that was going to be
something huge that or all our lives
we're going to change because of this
and this is another revolution I just
witnessed let's say on the sidelines and
this time as soon as I learned about
Bitcoin as I told you it was the end of
2012 I said this is going to check the
work I don't know if it's going to be
Bitcoin big key or a new iteration
of this concept but Fresno currencies
are here to change the world this is a
huge revolution and I want to be in the
front line I want to participate and
being actively involved in these
revolutions so that's why I really went
all in from the very first moment into
cryptocurrencies and also of course
because I understand as I told you I
understand the cypher punk movement I
understand at first sight the value
proposal of a crypto currencies a
cryptocurrency and that's why I ray I
immediately felt at home when i first
read about
about Bitcoin so what we do a
temper as you said is some sort of 21st
century notarization so we create this
proof of integrity and exist and that
cannot be damaged modified or destroyed
and because of that we need the
blockchain to be immutable and look I
was an investor in the ended ow invested
an on a sum of money that was not small
in the doubt but still I was against the
hard fork because I seem to believe that
erasing or modifying cryptographically
verified history it's against the
principle of a blockchain yes now in
hindsight I don't think that the three
foundation made a mistake I think they
what they did was for their
purposes or fail goals but still for a
company like stanbridge the blockchain
has to be immutable and it has it cannot
change you cannot roll back what happens
in a blockchain because then you create
a negative president 



**Christian Seberino:**
yes so it's
clear that your business depends
very strongly you immutability you
don't just need a lot of immutability
need a hundred percent of you ability or
whatever they're the right word is but
that's a core of your businesses that
you can depend on the the blockchain
data



**Daniele Levi:**
 exactly 



**Christian Seberino:**
and also a i'm not
a you know a great business person but a
one thing that's impressive i think
about stanberry is so many different
types of businesses need right they need
to notarize the verify data it's
right there's a universal need for that
no I think that's per
smart that you guys did that I actually
have a story that's a problem that i
recently had and I wanted to describe it
to you and maybe you could tell me if
stanberry could help could have helped
me with my situation now or in the
future can I tell you what happened



**Daniele Levi:**
 yes
of course



**Christian Seberino:**
 so I'm starting a little
business myself and with some partners
in Europe and they needed I guess too
they needed to prove my identity my
address so I they needed like a utility
bill copy of my drivers license and
there was another document that they
needed so I had to they said I had to be
notarized so I walked to the bank at
lunch three documents I had assigned
date then I had to then they notarized
it which I don't understand how how the
old notary works but somehow it's
supposed to make it more believable and
then I had to figure out how many
American stamps too I needed to send it
to all my documents to Europe and so I'm
still waiting out of the hollow how many
days but with something digital right it
could have been so much faster and
better what was that what could it have
helped in my situation



**Daniele Levi:**
 yes of course I
mean right now all these processes where
you still need to go to a third party
that has to get addie that indeed your
document is valid I think these
processes are one hundred percent
obsolete I mean why should you trust a
third party when you can have
mathematical proof right



**Christian Seberino:**
 yes


**Daniele Levi:**
so
because right now we are so used that we
have these trusted third parties that
put my reputation on the line and they
guarantee that something happen in a
certain way at a certain point of time
and all word has been based on these
kind of interactions and right now with
with blocking technology you don't need
to trust these third parties and if you
think about it's the same is the very
same principle
that ellos a decentralized currency to
do to happen and to work so you can take
this very same principle and apply it to
other stuff like for example certifying
that a digital attraction really happen
at a certain point of time and you don't
need anymore a third part to do this job
because at the end of the day the third
party it's a cost and it's also a
security problem because this third
party becomes a single point of failure
failure and I'd say that this is a
revolution that's going to affect many
many many different areas




**Christian Seberino:**
 okay but what
I'm just thinking out loud but let's say
I went to my bank all right let's say I
went to the my bank's website and I
downloaded or my the electric company
let's say and I downloaded a bill so now
maybe I have a PDF and so yours with
stanberry I could maybe
make a hash or something use your system
and put in put information on the
blockchain that would guarantee the
integrity 




**Daniele Levi:**
 yesintegrity it
would guarantee that that utility bill
or that document was never tampered with



**Christian Seberino:**
okay but here's what I here's
my question for you let's say that I
download or I get some document I tamper
with it first I changed maybe the
amount that I oh whatever and then I
know I Notre I used stamp Rihanna
tampered file



**Daniele Levi:**
 no of course I mean you
get a proof of integrity of the file you
embed it on the blockchain or essay of
the file whose hash you embed it on the
blockchain yes so you if you tampered
with the file previously then force the
system it's not going to work
probably you need the institution that
it's giving you the document
to hash it and to store it on the
blockchain



**Christian Seberino:**
 okay I could then that
would add another more value if
people cared about that makes
sense so and actually one thing if I
could add so maybe Stamper II might not
be able to guarantee that the original
file is correct but the Stanbury
could guarantee that let's say after
that like in one I don't change it
right from exotic it's fixed after that
so that's still useful also
and there'll be people that need that
service so that's great why
don't we now why don't you kind of I
think people now have an idea of the the
value of Stanbury what your business
does why don't we kind of talk more in
details about the process and the
technology how if somebody wanted to
notarize something whatever you call it
Stamper eyes I don't know how would they
do that is their website they go to or
application a download or what



**Daniele Levi:**
 yesso
look it's very simple and used for web
application at m dot do and we have a
web interface they just have to drag and
drop a file it can be a picture or a PDF
or whatever and then we create the hash
of this file and then we using a
technology we have built to be able to
scale we bundle together two together
all the hashes of the files that have
been stamped during a certain window of
time and then we create a cryptographic
tree of these hashes and then we take
the roots of this tree and we embed it
on both the ethereum classic blockchain
and the Bitcoin blockchain and then we
generate a proof which is all you need
to indefinitely verify that the file
that was stamped was indeed stamped with
that specific content at a certain point
of time at the other time
so you can use or web interface or the
interface or you can use our API if you
have if you need to do like recurrent
notarization for hundreds of data sets




**Christian Seberino:**
okay I have a question for you so if I
understand correctly the way that you
solve the scalability problem is if the
you hash all the documents within a
certain period of time together and then
that goes on the blockchain you know so
if you have a hundred different people
that that need that need a Stamper
eServices that you make a hash for those
hundred now how do you know it let's say
there was some tampering how do you know
which of those hundred documents is the
one that was tampered with



**Daniele Levi:**
 you have
your original document and then you also
have a proof which is a JSON file that
has all the siblings and by siblings we
mean the sibling hashes that need to
reconstruct the path from your document
to the route that was embedded on the
blockchain 




**Christian Seberino:**
so it's basically like
a Merkel tree is one of our country




**Daniele Levi:**
 yes




**Christian Seberino:**
okay so let's say okay so just to
give the audience an idea how this works
so let's say so I have a stamp rehash
now I'm concerned that there was
tampering so now I want to go
investigate the ash tree the Merkel tree
so where can I get this JSON file 







**Daniele Levi:**
the do
some slightly delivered to you together
as soon as you create the proof so okay
you have the JSON file and when you send
the original document to someone and you
want them to be able to check that
this document was not tampered with you
have to send them the proof to which is
a little file or also a PDF if you want
which is more easy to read





**Christian Seberino:**
 okay yes
that makes sense I was reading in
your papers you had your the blockchain
time-stamping archit
texture that you called it and you said
that you had you had solved the problem
of scalability so I I'm glad you
explained it because I wasn't sure how
how that worked but now it kind of makes
sense how you combine several document
hashes into one so then you said there
was a patent pending so this is some
original work I resist





**Daniele Levi:**
 yes this is 
some original work that we have done its
work done basically by my co-founder
Lewis even kwenda who is also co-founder
of Aragon and she's a project based in
in a film on a film project and also by
or CTO done






**Christian Seberino:**
 ok and I was just looking
at your website I took some notes
there's you had some ideas that
wreath applications people could use
stamp reef or one of them was trail bot
where you could use Stamper e
to make sure that your files and logs
haven't been tampered with like systems
system administrators yeah that was
joe you want to say something





**Daniele Levi:**
 yes
trade but it's one of the vertical
applications of this technology and we
believe that the legacy notarization
market is going to be very small
compared to the opportunity brought to
the market of fast and automatic data
set notarization so one of the first
interesting use cases that we analyzed
was to have a system that monitored all
your files so when a file changed it
took the difference and the change in
this file it made a stamp and then it
embedded on the on the on the blockchain
so you could trace all the changes that
happened in your system and you could
also create what we call smart policies
which are policies that are
that that the create actions when
something unexpected happens to your
file so imagine that a log file its
modified in a way that it's not expected
for example something it's erased from a
log file you connect either like a
hacker so you can trigger a smart policy
for example bringing down the system or
pinging a system administrator or
rolling back to to a cleans take Anna
and then you have all these trays of
everything that happened in your system
and all these trays cannot be erased or
modified because you have everything on
the on the on the blockchain so we built
this trail boat which is the application
that does all these 




**Christian Seberino:**
yes great so and
what is the if somebody out there is
interested what is the cost is there a
specific cost per file or how does
what's your cost structure 





**Daniele Levi:**
you again the
service is free we believe that this
kind of service has to be free 




**Christian Seberino:**
well
that'll certainly attract a lot of
people to use your service what is
then what's your revenue plan or
business plan just




**Daniele Levi:**
so bright right now
what we are doing its offering this
service for free we want as many people
as possible using it we won't understand
were this kind of service adds the more
value and then we will build a business
around it but the basic stamping that
it's going to be free in order in having
anything to become a commodity and it's
good that it becomes a commodity




**Christian Seberino:**
so
I'm just guessing but you so
you that kind of reminds me since you're
a smart business person so craigslist of
course I uh if I understand correctly so
pretty much the whole country America I
don't know if it's worldwide but it
pretty much the majority of people use
craigslist for free they make the put
free advertising
I believe they Craig Newmark I believe
that's his name he he only charges a
very small number of individuals I'd
like New York apartment renter people
renting in New York City or it was
businesses but he a very small number of
customers is enough to fund his
operation that allows him to give right
99 percent of the public free ads so
maybe you can do something like that
mate you're gonna you're most of your
revenue might come from enterprise usage
but individuals could use it for free
perhaps something like that





**Daniele Levi:**
 yes
something like that you can always start
for support lays so there are many
many different paths to generate revenue
but at the beginning for it's important
to have as many people as possible using
the service and as many companies as
possible using the service and at the
end of day if we don't give the stamping
the basic stamping or the blockchain
time stamping for free then another
company it will come and they will give
the service for free because the
marginal cost it's very little yes
and it makes sense to have this kind of
fast an automatic data notarization for
free then compute services on top for
which you can get out





**Christian Seberino:**
 yes
I'm glad that we cleared
that up because I was suspecting maybe
some people would be suspicious you know
how could they charge it for free you
know maybe they're in six months
they're gonna there it's not going to be
free anymore but you just gave a good
reason why it makes sense to keep it
free and so I with digital
technologies it's not very it's not
terribly expensive to give things for
free of course that's what Google does
and so that's it's not
too surprising that people could see
that you would do that so and
very nice now
I'm curious why don't we talk about like
how you're interacting with governments
is there any issues with regulations and
you have any thoughts on that 





**Daniele Levi:**
well so
regarding government's we have a
partnership with the government of
Estonia it's one of the most
advanced countries in the world they
have this e residency program and this
residency card that allows any arrested
to interact with government services
online you can do everything online even
vote honest it's ray Houghton yeah even
imposing getting married getting
divorced opening ominous sound opening a
bank account opening a company whatever
you want and regarding getting divorced
there is a fine story an estonian friend
told me that his wife has his irrational
card and also his pin because
sometimes they have to do some from some
stuff online and he is the the pinger
under to his wife for her too many good
things and taste that if she she
she becomes too angry she can divorce
online just with his car than his pin
number so you have to be careful being a
do everything online but
these guys in estonia do everything
online with their ear ascendancy card
and you can authenticate yourself on
stamping with an estonian a residency
card and you can sign any kind of
documents using this kind of a residency
card and also take the document and
notarize it using blockchain





**Christian Seberino:**
 ok can I
sku a another question about that so
at the beginning of the interview I told
you my story that I had to notarize
those three documents and send them to
Europe and how inconvenient that was and
I you had few through you threw out
the idea that if it was important
that the original document was trusted
that maybe I should have my bank or
the utility company make the hash and
put it on stanberry so do you is there
any discussions in a with American
companies or making or with American
regulators so that I could be able to go
to my bank and say hey you know a
utility company hey you know put this on
Stamper using this protocol



**Daniele Levi:**
 of course we
are having discussions the thing is that
when you need regulations to be changed
you normally have to wait a lot of time
and as a start-up you cannot count on
regulation changing to have a
sustainable business model so we are
basically focusing on non-regulated
areas so right now if for example to
open a bank account you have to have
with you or to bring with you a
notarized document we are not focusing
very much on that kind of use case
because you need to change the law
basically and they under regulations to
make that happen but yes we are having
discussions with Americans institutions
and you will see that soon there will be
some news about that and you have some
states that are looking forward to make
these kind of things happen for example
the Delaware State it's moving forward
to be able to incorporate blockchain
technology in many day-by-day processes
that now are very inefficient





**Christian Seberino:**
 yes
because not now in addition to having
the guarantees that Stanbury provides it
would be nice to have a legal precedent
or write that if the if Stanbury the
blockchain says
that something is true that a
court could believe it or they have to
they have to use that information if
there was somehow legal weight behind it
that would be nice so I don't know
what it would require for that to happen
but you see I'm saying





**Daniele Levi:**
 yes but I didn't
a big technology we are using it's very
standard cryptography it's we're just
using hashes and as you can imagine
hashes are used every day in court or
all our hard work and okay a hash it's a
solid proof of the integrity of the
existence of a certain data set and then
the fact that at times a blockchain
timestamp I cannot be tampered with its
has it pretty obvious of course this has
to be taken to court to set a precedent
and but in my opinion it's just a matter
of time 




**Christian Seberino:**
okay but it sounds from what you
said it sounds like you thought that
hashes had already been may be mentioned
in previous court cases so far so
that would imply so that would mean that
you could if you had to go to court if
somebody suits somebody you potentially
you could use Stamper I evidence right
to help you get to the truth and the
judge would would listen to that so so
it could be useful in a legal situation






**Daniele Levi:**
yes look I will give you an example of
a real use case stamp reuse case we have
this law firm that use a Stamper because
when they receive documents to be
analyzed for example in mergers and
acquisitions or in this kind of
operations they take all the documents
they receive and they stopped them with
with tampering so they have this proof
that the documents they received at a
certain point of time we then change
because they fear that when they are
analyzing this kind of documents and if
something changed for example because
they received all these documents
through a Google Drive or Dropbox or the
kind of blood service then they fear
that this document can suddenly change
and a liability could pop up that they
didn't see because it was not present in
a previous version of document and then
somebody could tell them how did you how
didn't you see this liability of two
million dollars or or whatever so using
Stanbury they can be sure that they have
proof of the content they received at a
certain point of time yes they use this
service to make sure of the integrity of
of those documents






**Christian Seberino:**
 yes so that's
encouraging right if the lawyers like
Stanbury that means that they think
there's validity there's that there's
legal weight behind it if it's necessary
so that's that the others that's good to
know let me go back and ask you one last
technical question so I'm impressed by
your solution to this scaling problem
how you combine hashes and you
said that it was similar to a Merkel
tree what you were doing if it's not
exactly the same so what was the what I
don't know if you want to say or maybe
you can't say or maybe you have to wait
for the patent but what why did you need
a patent what was the can you kind of
maybe give a description what was the
original thing in addition to the Merkel
tree that you had




**Daniele Levi:**
 I mean just as how if
just how do we use it in this specific
case and we needed the pattern just for
have it in a defensive fashion we
have a no intention of stopping others
in using a similar technology we just
applied for the pattern
to have as a defensive asset that's it




**Christian Seberino:**
okay I understand well 
yes I think
you've answered all my questions I think
people have a better idea of how Stamper
e works it seems the fact that it's free
and there's a global need Universal need
for your services I would think that
we're going to be hearing a lot from you
in the near future sounds like you have
a great business




**Daniele Levi:**
 thank you



**Christian Seberino:**
 so before we
close did you have anything else that
you wanted to to add that I missed that
I didn't ask 




**Daniele Levi:**
no I just want the book
thank you Chris 




**Christian Seberino:**
okay so in summary stamp
stamp arree provides essentially
notarization and related services and it
does it on digital files the service is
free and you can access the free
notarization service at stampede I oh
yep zacchara and it's useful for
all kinds of file system administrators
could use it for their log files right
as you said lawyers could use it for all
manner of files so really any kind of
digital content that people want to make
sure it hasn't been tampered with could
use your free service which is
great so thank you Danielle for
explaining that to us and so
